Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions."""

# - Loop Fission: loops can be separated to increase the parallelism of the code. This can increase the area and the latency. This can be done by rewriting the code manually.

I will run the synthesis and provide you with the results.
2. See one or more function options.
If you select this option you should reply with the following format:
"inspect: <function_name_1> <option_index>, <function_name_2> <option_index>, ..., <function_name_n> <option_index>"
