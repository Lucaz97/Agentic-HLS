System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve efficiency while maintaining correctness.
You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions.

Prompt:  Update the odd_factorial function to optimize it for HLS targetting latency.
        The function is 
```

  int res = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i += 2)

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve efficiency while maintaining correctness.
You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions.

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve efficiency while maintaining correctness.
You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions.

System Prompt:  
You are an HLS Optimization Agent tasked with optimizing a C application accelerated using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). 
You are part of an automated agentic flow, please reply following the instructed format.
Your goal is to find the best combination of function options that minimizes latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to a target value. 
At every iteration you have three options:
1. Synthesize a new configuration to evaluate its latency throughput and area.
If you select this option you should replay in the following format:
"synthesis: <function_name_1> <option_index>, <function_name_2> <option_index>, ..., <function_name_n> <option_index>" for each function in the application.
I will run the synthesis and provide you with the results.
2. See one or more function options.
If you select this option you should reply with the following format:
"inspect: <function_name_1> <option_index>, <function_name_2> <option_index>, ..., <function_name_n> <option_index>"
3. Run the a python script to solve an optimization problem using the google OR-Tools library.
If you select this option you should reply with the following format:
"python: '''<python_scipt_to_run>'''"
I will run the script and provide you with the results.
4. Run gprof on the applacation to profile the code.
If you select this option you should reply with the following format:
"profile"
I will run the gprof and provide you with the results.
5. Accept a solution and provide the final configuration.
If you select this option you should reply with the following format:
"solution: <function_name_1> <option_index>, <function_name_2> <option_index>, ..., <function_name_n> <option_index>"

Only reply with one of the five options following the format provided.

Prompt:  
This is the call graph for the application at hand:
{'odd_factorial': [], 'even_sum': [], 'compute1': ['odd_factorial', 'even_sum'], 'main': ['compute1', 'printf']}

The application has the following functions with their respective options:
Option for odd_factorial -  area: 3696.9, latency: 2.0, throughput: 3.0
Option for odd_factorial -  area: 3696.9, latency: 2.0, throughput: 3.0
Option for odd_factorial -  area: 35189.5, latency: 7.0, throughput: 8.0
Option for odd_factorial -  area: 4326.6, latency: 4.0, throughput: 5.0
Option for odd_factorial -  area: 3696.9, latency: 2.0, throughput: 3.0
Option for even_sum -  area: 1349.7, latency: 2.0, throughput: 3.0
Option for even_sum -  area: 3047.8, latency: 1.0, throughput: 2.0
Option for even_sum -  area: 1847.2, latency: 3.0, throughput: 4.0
Option for even_sum -  area: 2958.7, latency: 1.0, throughput: 2.0
Option for even_sum -  area: 1349.7, latency: 2.0, throughput: 3.0
Option for compute1 -  area: 3820.3, latency: 3.0, throughput: 4.0
Option for compute1 -  area: 3820.3, latency: 3.0, throughput: 4.0
Option for compute1 -  area: 3820.3, latency: 3.0, throughput: 4.0
Option for compute1 -  area: 3820.3, latency: 3.0, throughput: 4.0
Option for compute1 -  area: 3820.3, latency: 3.0, throughput: 4.0


Use the function names as provided, indexing the options starting from 0
The throughput is expressed in period, the lower the better.

The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions.
This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function.
Different options use different unrolling and pipelining factors. 

The goal is to minimize the latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 4000.
