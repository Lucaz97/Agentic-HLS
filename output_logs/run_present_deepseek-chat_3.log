        The current problem is:" 
 $PROJECT_HOME/tmp_present80_encryptBlock/copyKey_initial.c(17): Unsupported synthesis feature 'pointers-to-arrays on the interface' (CIN-70)

You can get rid of pointers in the interface using the array notation like

void foo(int a[SIZE]);

you will need to substitute SIZE with the size of the array. 

In the usage of the parameter a you can use the array notation as well, like a[i] instead of *a[i].


        

 include a function named copyKey that keeps the original function signature and calls the new copyKey_hls, this will serve as a wrapper. I will call this function in an automated test and provide feedback on the outcome.

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing.

You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions.

LLM RESPONSE:
To optimize the `copyKey_hls` function for latency, we can fully unroll the loop. This will reduce the latency at the cost of increased area usage. Here's the modified code:

```c
void copyKey_hls(present_key_t from, present_key_t to)
{
  #pragma hls_unroll yes
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
  {
    to[i] = from[i];
  }
}

void copyKey(present_key_t *from, present_key_t *to)
{
  copyKey_hls(*from, *to);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Loop Unrolling**: The loop is fully unrolled using `#pragma hls_unroll yes`. This means that all 10 iterations of the loop will be executed in parallel, reducing the latency significantly.
- **Latency Optimization**: By unrolling the loop, the function will complete in fewer clock cycles, which is ideal for latency-sensitive applications.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: The latency should be significantly reduced since the loop is fully unrolled, and all iterations are executed in parallel.
- **Area**: The area usage will increase due to the parallel execution of all loop iterations.

This modification should improve the latency of the `copyKey_hls` function while maintaining its original functionality.

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve efficiency while maintaining correctness.
You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions.

LLM RESPONSE:
The current solution already achieves the best possible latency of **1 clock cycle** and a throughput of **2**. This is because the loop is fully unrolled, and all operations are executed in parallel. However, the area usage is relatively high due to the parallel execution of all 10 iterations.

To further improve the solution, we can explore **partial unrolling** or **pipelining** to balance area and latency. However, since the goal is to optimize for latency, and the current solution already achieves the best latency, there is no room for further improvement in latency without increasing area.

### Current Solution Recap:
```c
void copyKey_hls(present_key_t from, present_key_t to)
{
  #pragma hls_unroll yes
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
  {
    to[i] = from[i];
  }
}

void copyKey(present_key_t *from, present_key_t *to)
{
  copyKey_hls(*from, *to);
}
```

### Why No Further Improvement is Possible:
1. **Latency**: The loop is fully unrolled, so all 10 assignments happen in a single clock cycle. This is the minimum possible latency.
2. **Throughput**: The throughput is already **2**, meaning the function can start a new operation every 2 clock cycles. This is optimal for this design.
3. **Area**: The area usage is high because all 10 assignments are executed in parallel. Reducing area would require reducing parallelism, which would increase latency.

### Alternative Approach (Optional):
If area reduction is a priority, we can partially unroll the loop. For example, unrolling by a factor of 2 would reduce area but increase latency to 5 clock cycles. However, this would not improve latency or throughput, so it is not recommended for this task.

### Final Recommendation:
The current solution is already optimal for latency. No further improvements are possible without sacrificing latency or throughput. If area reduction is desired, a different optimization goal (e.g., area optimization) should be considered.

LLM RESPONSE:
Given the synthesis report, the current solution already achieves the **best possible latency (1 clock cycle)** and **throughput (2)**. However, the area usage is relatively high due to the fully unrolled loop. Since the goal is to optimize for latency, and the current solution already achieves the best latency, there is no room for further improvement in latency or throughput without increasing area.

If the goal is to **reduce area** while maintaining the same latency and throughput, we can explore **partial unrolling** or **pipelining**. However, these changes will likely increase latency or reduce throughput, which contradicts the optimization goal.

### Current Solution Recap:
```c
void copyKey_hls(present_key_t from, present_key_t to)
{
  #pragma hls_unroll yes
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
  {
    to[i] = from[i];
  }
}

void copyKey(present_key_t *from, present_key_t *to)
{
  copyKey_hls(*from, *to);
}
```

### Why No Further Improvement is Possible:
1. **Latency**: The loop is fully unrolled, so all 10 assignments happen in a single clock cycle. This is the minimum possible latency.
2. **Throughput**: The throughput is already **2**, meaning the function can start a new operation every 2 clock cycles. This is optimal for this design.
3. **Area**: The area usage is high because all 10 assignments are executed in parallel. Reducing area would require reducing parallelism, which would increase latency.

### Alternative Approach (Optional):
If area reduction is a priority, we can partially unroll the loop. For example, unrolling by a factor of 2 would reduce area but increase latency to 5 clock cycles. However, this would not improve latency or throughput, so it is not recommended for this task.

### Final Recommendation:
The current solution is already optimal for latency. No further improvements are possible without sacrificing latency or throughput. If area reduction is desired, a different optimization goal (e.g., area optimization) should be considered.

```c
void copyKey_hls(present_key_t from, present_key_t to)
{
  #pragma hls_unroll yes
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
  {
    to[i] = from[i];
  }
}

void copyKey(present_key_t *from, present_key_t *to)
{
  copyKey_hls(*from, *to);
}
```

If you still want to explore alternative solutions, let me know, and I can provide a version with partial unrolling or pipelining for area reduction, but it will come at the cost of increased latency or reduced throughput.

You can get rid of pointers in the interface using the array notation like

void foo(int a[SIZE]);

you will need to substitute SIZE with the size of the array. 

In the usage of the parameter a you can use the array notation as well, like a[i] instead of *a[i].


        

 include a function named copyBlock that keeps the original function signature and calls the new copyBlock_hls, this will serve as a wrapper. I will call this function in an automated test and provide feedback on the outcome.

LLM RESPONSE:
To optimize the `copyBlock_hls` function for latency, we can fully unroll the loop. This will reduce the latency at the cost of increased area usage. Here's the modified code:

```c
void copyBlock_hls(block_t from, block_t to)
{
  #pragma hls_unroll yes
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
  {
    to[i] = from[i];
  }
}

void copyBlock(block_t *from, block_t *to)
{
  copyBlock_hls(*from, *to);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Loop Unrolling**: The loop is fully unrolled using `#pragma hls_unroll yes`. This means that all 8 iterations of the loop will be executed in parallel, reducing the latency significantly.
- **Latency Optimization**: By unrolling the loop, the function will complete in a single cycle (or very few cycles), which is ideal for latency optimization.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: The latency will be reduced significantly, potentially to just a few cycles or even a single cycle, depending on the hardware.
- **Area**: The area usage will increase due to the parallel execution of all loop iterations.

This modification should improve the latency of the `copyBlock_hls` function while maintaining its original functionality.

LLM RESPONSE:
The current solution achieves the best possible latency of **1 cycle** and a throughput of **2 cycles**, which is excellent for latency optimization. However, the area usage is relatively high due to full loop unrolling. Since the latency and throughput are already optimal, further improvements would focus on reducing area usage while maintaining the same latency and throughput.

### Optimized Solution:
To reduce area usage, we can partially unroll the loop instead of fully unrolling it. This will still achieve low latency but with a smaller area footprint. Here's the updated code:

```c
void copyBlock_hls(block_t from, block_t to)

### Explanation:
- **Partial Loop Unrolling**: The loop is unrolled with a factor of 4 (`#pragma hls_unroll 4`). This means the loop will execute in 2 iterations (8 elements / 4 unroll factor), reducing the area usage compared to full unrolling.
- **Latency and Throughput**: The latency remains low (likely 1-2 cycles), and the throughput is maintained at 2 cycles.
- **Area Reduction**: By unrolling the loop partially, fewer resources are used, which reduces the area footprint.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: Remains at 1-2 cycles.
- **Throughput**: Remains at 2 cycles.
- **Area**: Reduced compared to the fully unrolled version, as fewer parallel operations are performed.

This solution strikes a balance between latency, throughput, and area usage. If further area reduction is required, we can experiment with smaller unroll factors (e.g., 2), but this may slightly increase latency. Let me know if you'd like to explore that option!

LLM RESPONSE:
The current solution with partial unrolling (`#pragma hls_unroll 4`) has increased latency to **3 cycles** and throughput to **6 cycles**, while reducing area usage. However, this is not ideal since the previous fully unrolled version achieved better latency and throughput. To improve the solution, we need to balance area, latency, and throughput.

### Revised Solution:
To achieve the best latency and throughput while minimizing area, we can use **pipelining** instead of unrolling. Pipelining allows the loop to execute with a lower initiation interval (II), improving throughput without significantly increasing area. Here's the updated code:

### Explanation:
- **Pipelining**: The loop is pipelined with an initiation interval of 1 (`#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1`). This means a new iteration can start every cycle, improving throughput.
- **Latency**: The latency will be slightly higher than fully unrolled but significantly lower than partially unrolled.
- **Throughput**: The throughput will be improved, as the loop can process one element per cycle.
- **Area**: Pipelining typically uses fewer resources than full unrolling, resulting in a smaller area footprint.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: Likely 2-3 cycles (better than partial unrolling but slightly worse than full unrolling).
- **Throughput**: Improved to 1 cycle per element (better than partial unrolling).
- **Area**: Reduced compared to full unrolling, as fewer parallel operations are performed.

This solution provides a better balance between latency, throughput, and area. If further area reduction is required, we can experiment with a higher initiation interval (e.g., II=2), but this may slightly increase latency and reduce throughput. Let me know if you'd like to explore that option!

Here's the updated code:\n\n```c\nvoid copyBlock_hls(block_t from, block_t to)\n{\n  #pragma hls_unroll 2\n  #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1\n  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)\n  {\n    to[i] = from[i];\n  }\n}\n\nvoid copyBlock(block_t *from, block_t *to)\n{\n  copyBlock_hls(*from, *to);\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Partial Unrolling (Factor of 2)**: The loop is unrolled with a factor of 2, meaning two iterations are executed in parallel. This reduces the number of parallel operations compared to full unrolling, saving area.\n- **Pipelining**: The loop is pipelined with an initiation interval of 1 (`#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1`), allowing a new iteration to start every cycle. This improves throughput.\n- **Latency and Throughput**: The latency will be lower than the fully pipelined version, and the throughput will be better than the partially unrolled version without pipelining.\n- **Area**: The area usage will be reduced compared to full unrolling, as fewer parallel operations are performed.\n\n### Expected Impact:\n- **Latency**: Likely 2-4 cycles (better than the fully pipelined version but slightly worse than full unrolling).\n- **Throughput**: Improved to 1-2 cycles per element (better than the partially unrolled version without pipelining).\n- **Area**: Reduced compared to full unrolling, as fewer parallel operations are performed.\n\nThis hybrid approach should provide a better balance between latency, throughput, and area. If further area reduction is required, we can experiment with a higher unroll factor (e.g., 4) or a higher initiation interval (e.g., II=2), but this may slightly increase latency and reduce throughput.

LLM RESPONSE:
The current pipelined solution has increased latency to **8 cycles** and throughput to **11 cycles**, which is worse than the fully unrolled version. To improve the solution, we need to revisit the optimization strategy. Since the fully unrolled version achieved the best latency and throughput, but at the cost of high area usage, we can explore a hybrid approach that combines partial unrolling and pipelining to achieve a better balance.

### Revised Solution:
We will use **partial unrolling** with a factor of 2 and **pipelining** to reduce area while maintaining good latency and throughput. Here's the updated code:

```c
void copyBlock_hls(block_t from, block_t to)
{
  #pragma hls_unroll 2
  #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
  {
    to[i] = from[i];
  }
}

void copyBlock(block_t *from, block_t *to)
{
  copyBlock_hls(*from, *to);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Partial Unrolling (Factor of 2)**: The loop is unrolled with a factor of 2, meaning two iterations are executed in parallel. This reduces the number of parallel operations compared to full unrolling, saving area.
- **Pipelining**: The loop is pipelined with an initiation interval of 1 (`#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1`), allowing a new iteration to start every cycle. This improves throughput.
- **Latency and Throughput**: The latency will be lower than the fully pipelined version, and the throughput will be better than the partially unrolled version without pipelining.
- **Area**: The area usage will be reduced compared to full unrolling, as fewer parallel operations are performed.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: Likely 2-4 cycles (better than the fully pipelined version but slightly worse than full unrolling).
- **Throughput**: Improved to 1-2 cycles per element (better than the partially unrolled version without pipelining).
- **Area**: Reduced compared to full unrolling, as fewer parallel operations are performed.

This hybrid approach should provide a better balance between latency, throughput, and area. If further area reduction is required, we can experiment with a higher unroll factor (e.g., 4) or a higher initiation interval (e.g., II=2), but this may slightly increase latency and reduce throughput. Let me know if you'd like to explore that option!

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve efficiency while maintaining correctness.
You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions.

The current hybrid solution (partial unrolling with a factor of 2 and pipelining) achieves a latency of **4 cycles** and throughput of **7 cycles**, which is an improvement over the fully pipelined version but still not as good as the fully unrolled version. However, the area usage is still relatively high.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: Minimized to **1 cycle** (best possible).
- **Throughput**: Maximized to **2 cycles** (best possible).
- **Area**: Slightly higher than the partially unrolled version but still optimized due to pipelining.

This solution achieves the best latency and throughput while keeping area usage as low as possible. If further area reduction is required, we can consider reducing the unroll factor (e.g., 4 or 2), but this will increase latency and reduce throughput.

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment.
Your task is to rewrite generic C code into HLS-compatible C code while ensuring correctness and synthesizability.
Modify only the specified functions while leaving the rest of the code unchanged. 
Do not add pragmas or directives; the HLS tool should infer the correct behavior. 
Do not provide main functions or testbenches. Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve compatibility and efficiency for hardware implementation.
I do not need a code explanation in the answer.

Model:  deepseek-chat
Prompt:  Help me rewrite the generateRoundKeys80 function to be compatible with HLS, name the new function generateRoundKeys80_hls: 
```
void generateRoundKeys80(present_key_t *suppliedKey, keys_t *keys)
{
  present_key_t key;
  present_key_t newKey;
  unsigned char i;
  unsigned char j;
  copyKey(suppliedKey, &key);
  copyBlock((block_t *) (&key), &(*keys)[0]);
  for (i = 1; i < 32; i++)
  {
    for (j = 0; j < 10; j++)
    {
      newKey[j] = (key[(j + 7) % 10] << 5) | (key[(j + 8) % 10] >> 3);
    }

    copyKey(&newKey, &key);
    key[0] = (sBox[key[0] >> 4] << 4) | (key[0] & 0xF);
    key[8] ^= i << 7;
    key[7] ^= i >> 1;
    copyBlock((block_t *) (&key), &(*keys)[i]);
  }

}

```
 
        The following child functions and includes will be provided with the following signature, assume them present in the code:
        
```#include <stdio.h>

#define PRESENT_80_KEY_SIZE_BYTES 10
#define PRESENT_BLOCK_SIZE_BYTES 8
#define ROUNDS               32
#define ROUND_KEY_SIZE_BYTES  8
typedef unsigned char keys_t[ROUNDS][ROUND_KEY_SIZE_BYTES];
typedef unsigned char present_key_t[PRESENT_80_KEY_SIZE_BYTES];
typedef unsigned char round_key_t[ROUND_KEY_SIZE_BYTES];
typedef unsigned char block_t[PRESENT_BLOCK_SIZE_BYTES];
unsigned char sBox[16] = {
    0xC, 0x5, 0x6, 0xB, 0x9, 0x0, 0xA, 0xD, 0x3, 0xE, 0xF, 0x8, 0x4, 0x7, 0x1, 0x2 };

unsigned char sBoxInverse[16] = {
        0x5, 0xE, 0xF, 0x8, 0xC, 0x1, 0x2, 0xD, 0xB, 0x4, 0x6, 0x3, 0x0, 0x7, 0x9, 0xA };


void copyKey_hls(present_key_t from, present_key_t to);
void copyBlock_hls(block_t from, block_t to);

```

        The current problem is:" 
 $PROJECT_HOME/tmp_present80_encryptBlock/generateRoundKeys80_initial.c(39): Unsupported synthesis feature 'pointers-to-arrays on the interface' (CIN-70)

You can get rid of pointers in the interface using the array notation like

void foo(int a[SIZE]);

you will need to substitute SIZE with the size of the array. 

In the usage of the parameter a you can use the array notation as well, like a[i] instead of *a[i].


        

 include a function named generateRoundKeys80 that keeps the original function signature and calls the new generateRoundKeys80_hls, this will serve as a wrapper. I will call this function in an automated test and provide feedback on the outcome.

 $PROJECT_HOME/tmp_present80_encryptBlock/generateRoundKeys80_llm.c(57): Invalid pointer cast from 'present_key_t *' to 'block_t *' (CIN-71)

You can get rid of pointers in the interface using the array notation like

void foo(int a[SIZE]);

you will need to substitute SIZE with the size of the array. 

In the usage of the parameter a you can use the array notation as well, like a[i] instead of *a[i].


                

 include a function named generateRoundKeys80 that keeps the original function signature and calls the new generateRoundKeys80_hls, this will serve as a wrapper. I will call this function in an automated test and provide feedback on the outcome.

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve efficiency while maintaining correctness.
You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions.

LLM RESPONSE:
To optimize the `generateRoundKeys80_hls` function for latency, we will focus on reducing the number of cycles required to complete the operation. This can be achieved by unrolling loops and pipelining where appropriate. Since the goal is to minimize latency, we will unroll the inner loop completely and pipeline the outer loop to reduce the initiation interval.

Here is the modified code:

```c
void generateRoundKeys80_hls(present_key_t suppliedKey, keys_t keys)
{
  present_key_t key;
  present_key_t newKey;
  unsigned char i;
  unsigned char j;

  }
}

void generateRoundKeys80(present_key_t *suppliedKey, keys_t *keys)
{
  generateRoundKeys80_hls(*suppliedKey, *keys);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Unrolling**: The inner loop (`for (j = 0; j < 10; j++)`) is unrolled completely using `#pragma hls_unroll yes`. This reduces the number of iterations and thus the latency, as all operations in the loop are executed in parallel.

2. **Pipelining**: The outer loop (`for (i = 1; i < 32; i++)`) is pipelined with an initiation interval of 1 using `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1`. This allows the next iteration to start as soon as possible, improving throughput and reducing overall latency.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: The unrolling of the inner loop should significantly reduce the latency by eliminating the loop overhead and allowing parallel execution of the loop body.
- **Throughput**: Pipelining the outer loop with an initiation interval of 1 should improve throughput by allowing new iterations to start every cycle.

This optimization should result in a lower latency compared to the original design, as the inner loop is fully unrolled and the outer loop is pipelined.

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve efficiency while maintaining correctness.
You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions.

LLM RESPONSE:
To further improve the solution, we need to focus on reducing latency while keeping area and throughput in check. The current design has a latency of 596 cycles, which is relatively high. We can attempt to reduce this by further optimizing the loop structure and ensuring that the pipelining and unrolling directives are applied effectively.

Here’s an updated version of the `generateRoundKeys80_hls` function with additional optimizations:

```c
void generateRoundKeys80_hls(present_key_t suppliedKey, keys_t keys)
{
  present_key_t key;
  present_key_t newKey;
  unsigned char i;
  unsigned char j;
  copyKey_hls(suppliedKey, key);
  copyBlock_hls(key, keys[0]);

  #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
  for (i = 1; i < 32; i++)
  {
    #pragma hls_unroll yes
    for (j = 0; j < 10; j++)
    {
      newKey[j] = (key[(j + 7) % 10] << 5) | (key[(j + 8) % 10] >> 3);
    }

    copyKey_hls(newKey, key);
    key[0] = (sBox[key[0] >> 4] << 4) | (key[0] & 0xF);
    key[8] ^= i << 7;
    key[7] ^= i >> 1;
    copyBlock_hls(key, keys[i]);
  }
}

void generateRoundKeys80(present_key_t *suppliedKey, keys_t *keys)
{
  generateRoundKeys80_hls(*suppliedKey, *keys);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Unrolling**: The inner loop (`for (j = 0; j < 10; j++)`) is unrolled completely using `#pragma hls_unroll yes`. This reduces the number of iterations and thus the latency, as all operations in the loop are executed in parallel.

2. **Pipelining**: The outer loop (`for (i = 1; i < 32; i++)`) is pipelined with an initiation interval of 1 using `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1`. This allows the next iteration to start as soon as possible, improving throughput and reducing overall latency.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: The unrolling of the inner loop should significantly reduce the latency by eliminating the loop overhead and allowing parallel execution of the loop body.
- **Throughput**: Pipelining the outer loop with an initiation interval of 1 should improve throughput by allowing new iterations to start every cycle.

This optimization should result in a lower latency compared to the original design, as the inner loop is fully unrolled and the outer loop is pipelined. The area might increase slightly due to the unrolling, but the latency should be significantly reduced.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Area**: The area might increase due to the unrolling of the inner loop, but the trade-off is acceptable given the reduction in latency.
- **Throughput**: The throughput should improve due to the pipelining of the outer loop.

This version should provide a better balance between latency, throughput, and area compared to the previous design.

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve efficiency while maintaining correctness.
You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions.

LLM RESPONSE:
To further improve the solution, we need to focus on reducing latency while keeping area and throughput in check. The current design has a latency of 596 cycles, which is relatively high. We can attempt to reduce this by further optimizing the loop structure and ensuring that the pipelining and unrolling directives are applied effectively.

Here’s an updated version of the `generateRoundKeys80_hls` function with additional optimizations:

```c
void generateRoundKeys80_hls(present_key_t suppliedKey, keys_t keys)
{
  present_key_t key;
  present_key_t newKey;
  unsigned char i;
  unsigned char j;
  copyKey_hls(suppliedKey, key);
  copyBlock_hls(key, keys[0]);

  #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
  for (i = 1; i < 32; i++)
  {
    #pragma hls_unroll yes
    for (j = 0; j < 10; j++)
    {
      newKey[j] = (key[(j + 7) % 10] << 5) | (key[(j + 8) % 10] >> 3);
    }

    copyKey_hls(newKey, key);
    key[0] = (sBox[key[0] >> 4] << 4) | (key[0] & 0xF);
    key[8] ^= i << 7;
    key[7] ^= i >> 1;
    copyBlock_hls(key, keys[i]);
  }
}

void generateRoundKeys80(present_key_t *suppliedKey, keys_t *keys)
{
  generateRoundKeys80_hls(*suppliedKey, *keys);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Unrolling**: The inner loop (`for (j = 0; j < 10; j++)`) is unrolled completely using `#pragma hls_unroll yes`. This reduces the number of iterations and thus the latency, as all operations in the loop are executed in parallel.

2. **Pipelining**: The outer loop (`for (i = 1; i < 32; i++)`) is pipelined with an initiation interval of 1 using `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1`. This allows the next iteration to start as soon as possible, improving throughput and reducing overall latency.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: The unrolling of the inner loop should significantly reduce the latency by eliminating the loop overhead and allowing parallel execution of the loop body.
- **Throughput**: Pipelining the outer loop with an initiation interval of 1 should improve throughput by allowing new iterations to start every cycle.

This optimization should result in a lower latency compared to the original design, as the inner loop is fully unrolled and the outer loop is pipelined. The area might increase slightly due to the unrolling, but the latency should be significantly reduced.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Area**: The area might increase due to the unrolling of the inner loop, but the trade-off is acceptable given the reduction in latency.
- **Throughput**: The throughput should improve due to the pipelining of the outer loop.

This version should provide a better balance between latency, throughput, and area compared to the previous design.

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve efficiency while maintaining correctness.
You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions.

LLM RESPONSE:
To further improve the solution, we need to focus on reducing latency while keeping area and throughput in check. The current design has a latency of 596 cycles, which is relatively high. We can attempt to reduce this by further optimizing the loop structure and ensuring that the pipelining and unrolling directives are applied effectively.

Here’s an updated version of the `generateRoundKeys80_hls` function with additional optimizations:

```c
void generateRoundKeys80_hls(present_key_t suppliedKey, keys_t keys)
{
  present_key_t key;
  present_key_t newKey;
  unsigned char i;
  unsigned char j;
  copyKey_hls(suppliedKey, key);
  copyBlock_hls(key, keys[0]);

  #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
  for (i = 1; i < 32; i++)
  {
    #pragma hls_unroll yes
    for (j = 0; j < 10; j++)
    {
      newKey[j] = (key[(j + 7) % 10] << 5) | (key[(j + 8) % 10] >> 3);
    }

    copyKey_hls(newKey, key);
    key[0] = (sBox[key[0] >> 4] << 4) | (key[0] & 0xF);
    key[8] ^= i << 7;
    key[7] ^= i >> 1;
    copyBlock_hls(key, keys[i]);
  }
}

void generateRoundKeys80(present_key_t *suppliedKey, keys_t *keys)
{
  generateRoundKeys80_hls(*suppliedKey, *keys);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Unrolling**: The inner loop (`for (j = 0; j < 10; j++)`) is unrolled completely using `#pragma hls_unroll yes`. This reduces the number of iterations and thus the latency, as all operations in the loop are executed in parallel.

2. **Pipelining**: The outer loop (`for (i = 1; i < 32; i++)`) is pipelined with an initiation interval of 1 using `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1`. This allows the next iteration to start as soon as possible, improving throughput and reducing overall latency.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: The unrolling of the inner loop should significantly reduce the latency by eliminating the loop overhead and allowing parallel execution of the loop body.
- **Throughput**: Pipelining the outer loop with an initiation interval of 1 should improve throughput by allowing new iterations to start every cycle.

This optimization should result in a lower latency compared to the original design, as the inner loop is fully unrolled and the outer loop is pipelined. The area might increase slightly due to the unrolling, but the latency should be significantly reduced.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Area**: The area might increase due to the unrolling of the inner loop, but the trade-off is acceptable given the reduction in latency.
- **Throughput**: The throughput should improve due to the pipelining of the outer loop.

This version should provide a better balance between latency, throughput, and area compared to the previous design.

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve efficiency while maintaining correctness.
You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions.

LLM RESPONSE:
To further improve the solution, we need to focus on reducing latency while keeping area and throughput in check. The current design has a latency of 596 cycles, which is relatively high. We can attempt to reduce this by further optimizing the loop structure and ensuring that the pipelining and unrolling directives are applied effectively.

Here’s an updated version of the `generateRoundKeys80_hls` function with additional optimizations:

```c
void generateRoundKeys80_hls(present_key_t suppliedKey, keys_t keys)
{
  present_key_t key;
  present_key_t newKey;
  unsigned char i;
  unsigned char j;
  copyKey_hls(suppliedKey, key);
  copyBlock_hls(key, keys[0]);

  #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
  for (i = 1; i < 32; i++)
  {
    #pragma hls_unroll yes
    for (j = 0; j < 10; j++)
    {
      newKey[j] = (key[(j + 7) % 10] << 5) | (key[(j + 8) % 10] >> 3);
    }

    copyKey_hls(newKey, key);
    key[0] = (sBox[key[0] >> 4] << 4) | (key[0] & 0xF);
    key[8] ^= i << 7;
    key[7] ^= i >> 1;
    copyBlock_hls(key, keys[i]);
  }
}

void generateRoundKeys80(present_key_t *suppliedKey, keys_t *keys)
{
  generateRoundKeys80_hls(*suppliedKey, *keys);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Unrolling**: The inner loop (`for (j = 0; j < 10; j++)`) is unrolled completely using `#pragma hls_unroll yes`. This reduces the number of iterations and thus the latency, as all operations in the loop are executed in parallel.

2. **Pipelining**: The outer loop (`for (i = 1; i < 32; i++)`) is pipelined with an initiation interval of 1 using `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1`. This allows the next iteration to start as soon as possible, improving throughput and reducing overall latency.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: The unrolling of the inner loop should significantly reduce the latency by eliminating the loop overhead and allowing parallel execution of the loop body.
- **Throughput**: Pipelining the outer loop with an initiation interval of 1 should improve throughput by allowing new iterations to start every cycle.

This optimization should result in a lower latency compared to the original design, as the inner loop is fully unrolled and the outer loop is pipelined. The area might increase slightly due to the unrolling, but the latency should be significantly reduced.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Area**: The area might increase due to the unrolling of the inner loop, but the trade-off is acceptable given the reduction in latency.
- **Throughput**: The throughput should improve due to the pipelining of the outer loop.

This version should provide a better balance between latency, throughput, and area compared to the previous design.

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment.
Your task is to rewrite generic C code into HLS-compatible C code while ensuring correctness and synthesizability.
Modify only the specified functions while leaving the rest of the code unchanged. 
Do not add pragmas or directives; the HLS tool should infer the correct behavior. 
Do not provide main functions or testbenches. Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve compatibility and efficiency for hardware implementation.
I do not need a code explanation in the answer.

        The current problem is:" 
 $PROJECT_HOME/tmp_present80_encryptBlock/addRoundKey_initial.c(17): Unsupported synthesis feature 'pointers-to-arrays on the interface' (CIN-70)

You can get rid of pointers in the interface using the array notation like

void foo(int a[SIZE]);

you will need to substitute SIZE with the size of the array. 

In the usage of the parameter a you can use the array notation as well, like a[i] instead of *a[i].


        

 include a function named addRoundKey that keeps the original function signature and calls the new addRoundKey_hls, this will serve as a wrapper. I will call this function in an automated test and provide feedback on the outcome.

LLM RESPONSE:
To optimize the `addRoundKey_hls` function for latency, we can fully unroll the loop since the loop has a fixed number of iterations (8). This will reduce the latency by eliminating the loop control overhead and allowing all operations to be performed in parallel. Here is the modified code:

```c
void addRoundKey_hls(block_t block, round_key_t roundKey)
{
  #pragma hls_unroll yes
  for (unsigned char i = 0; i < 8; i++)
  {
    block[i] ^= roundKey[i];
  }
}

void addRoundKey(block_t *block, round_key_t *roundKey)
{
  addRoundKey_hls(*block, *roundKey);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Loop Unrolling**: The loop is fully unrolled using `#pragma hls_unroll yes`. This means that all 8 iterations of the loop will be executed in parallel, reducing the latency significantly.
- **Latency Optimization**: By unrolling the loop, we eliminate the need for loop control logic, which reduces the number of clock cycles required to complete the operation. This is particularly beneficial when targeting low latency.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: The latency should be reduced significantly since all XOR operations are performed in parallel.
- **Area**: The area will increase due to the parallel execution of all 8 XOR operations, but this is acceptable when optimizing for latency.

This modification should improve the latency of the `addRoundKey_hls` function while maintaining the original functionality.

LLM RESPONSE:
The current solution already achieves **0 latency** and **2 throughput**, which is excellent for latency optimization. However, the **area usage** is relatively high (126.1). To further improve the design, we can explore reducing the area while maintaining the same latency and throughput. Here's an updated version of the code:

### Optimized Code:
```c
void addRoundKey_hls(block_t block, round_key_t roundKey)
{
  #pragma hls_unroll yes
  for (unsigned char i = 0; i < 8; i++)
  {
    #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
    block[i] ^= roundKey[i];
  }
}

void addRoundKey(block_t *block, round_key_t *roundKey)
{
  addRoundKey_hls(*block, *roundKey);
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Pipeline the XOR Operations**: Added `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1` inside the unrolled loop. This ensures that each XOR operation is pipelined with an initiation interval of 1, which helps reduce resource usage while maintaining the same latency and throughput.
2. **Maintain Full Unrolling**: The loop is still fully unrolled (`#pragma hls_unroll yes`) to ensure all operations are performed in parallel, keeping the latency at 0.

### Expected Impact:
- **Area**: The pipelining should reduce the resource usage (area) by optimizing the hardware implementation of the XOR operations.
- **Latency and Throughput**: These metrics should remain unchanged (latency = 0, throughput = 2) since the pipelining does not introduce additional cycles.

### Synthesis Report Expectations:
- **Area**: Should decrease compared to the previous solution (126.1).
- **Latency**: Remains at 0.
- **Throughput**: Remains at 2.

This solution strikes a balance between area optimization and maintaining the best possible latency and throughput. Let me know if further refinements are needed!

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve efficiency while maintaining correctness.
You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions.

LLM RESPONSE:
The current solution already achieves **0 latency** and **2 throughput**, which is optimal for latency optimization. However, the **area usage** (126.1) can potentially be reduced further. To improve the area while maintaining the same latency and throughput, we can explore **partial unrolling** of the loop instead of full unrolling. This reduces the number of parallel operations, which can lower resource usage.

Here’s an updated version of the code:

### Optimized Code:
```c
void addRoundKey_hls(block_t block, round_key_t roundKey)
{
  #pragma hls_unroll factor=4
  for (unsigned char i = 0; i < 8; i++)
  {
    block[i] ^= roundKey[i];
  }
}

void addRoundKey(block_t *block, round_key_t *roundKey)
{
  addRoundKey_hls(*block, *roundKey);
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Partial Unrolling**: The loop is unrolled with a factor of 4 (`#pragma hls_unroll factor=4`). This means the loop will be split into 2 iterations (8 / 4 = 2), reducing the number of parallel XOR operations from 8 to 4. This should reduce the area usage while still maintaining low latency and high throughput.
2. **No Pipelining**: Pipelining is not applied here because the loop is already unrolled, and pipelining would not significantly improve area in this case.

### Expected Impact:
- **Area**: The area should decrease because fewer resources are used for parallel XOR operations.
- **Latency**: The latency should remain close to 0, as the loop is still partially unrolled.
- **Throughput**: The throughput should remain at 2, as the loop is still executed efficiently.

### Synthesis Report Expectations:
- **Area**: Should decrease compared to the previous solution (126.1).
- **Latency**: Should remain at 0.
- **Throughput**: Should remain at 2.

This solution aims to reduce area usage while maintaining the same latency and throughput. Let me know if further refinements are needed!

LLM RESPONSE:
The current synthesis report shows that the partial unrolling approach increased latency and reduced throughput compared to the fully unrolled solution. To restore the optimal latency (0) and throughput (2) while still attempting to reduce area, we can revisit the fully unrolled solution and explore other area-saving techniques.

### Optimized Code:
```c
void addRoundKey_hls(block_t block, round_key_t roundKey)
{
  #pragma hls_unroll yes
  for (unsigned char i = 0; i < 8; i++)
  {
    #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
    block[i] ^= roundKey[i];
  }
}

void addRoundKey(block_t *block, round_key_t *roundKey)
{
  addRoundKey_hls(*block, *roundKey);
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Fully Unrolled Loop**: The loop is fully unrolled (`#pragma hls_unroll yes`) to ensure all 8 XOR operations are performed in parallel, achieving 0 latency and high throughput.
2. **Pipelining**: Added `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1` to pipeline each XOR operation. This ensures that the hardware resources are used efficiently, potentially reducing area while maintaining the same latency and throughput.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: Remains at 0 due to full unrolling.
- **Throughput**: Remains at 2 due to pipelining.
- **Area**: The pipelining should help reduce resource usage compared to the fully unrolled solution without pipelining.

### Synthesis Report Expectations:
- **Area**: Should be lower than the previous fully unrolled solution (126.1).
- **Latency**: Should remain at 0.
- **Throughput**: Should remain at 2.

This solution aims to restore the optimal latency and throughput while minimizing area usage. Let me know if further refinements are needed!

Last Catapult run:  Catapult_1274
System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve efficiency while maintaining correctness.
You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions.

LLM RESPONSE:
The current solution achieves **0 latency** and **2 throughput**, which is optimal for latency optimization. However, the **area usage** (126.1) can potentially be reduced further. To improve the area while maintaining the same latency and throughput, we can explore **resource sharing** by reducing the number of parallel XOR operations. This can be achieved by partially unrolling the loop and pipelining the operations.

Here’s an updated version of the code:

### Optimized Code:
```c
void addRoundKey_hls(block_t block, round_key_t roundKey)
{
  #pragma hls_unroll factor=2
  for (unsigned char i = 0; i < 8; i++)
  {
    #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
    block[i] ^= roundKey[i];
  }
}

void addRoundKey(block_t *block, round_key_t *roundKey)
{
  addRoundKey_hls(*block, *roundKey);
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Partial Unrolling**: The loop is unrolled with a factor of 2 (`#pragma hls_unroll factor=2`). This means the loop will be split into 4 iterations (8 / 2 = 4), reducing the number of parallel XOR operations from 8 to 2. This should reduce the area usage while still maintaining low latency and high throughput.
2. **Pipelining**: Added `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1` to pipeline each XOR operation. This ensures efficient resource utilization and maintains the throughput.

### Expected Impact:
- **Area**: The area should decrease because fewer resources are used for parallel XOR operations.
- **Latency**: The latency should remain close to 0, as the loop is still partially unrolled and pipelined.
- **Throughput**: The throughput should remain at 2, as the loop is still executed efficiently.

### Synthesis Report Expectations:
- **Area**: Should decrease compared to the previous solution (126.1).
- **Latency**: Should remain at 0.
- **Throughput**: Should remain at 2.

This solution aims to reduce area usage while maintaining the same latency and throughput. Let me know if further refinements are needed!

You can get rid of pointers in the interface using the array notation like

void foo(int a[SIZE]);

you will need to substitute SIZE with the size of the array. 

In the usage of the parameter a you can use the array notation as well, like a[i] instead of *a[i].


        

 include a function named pLayer that keeps the original function signature and calls the new pLayer_hls, this will serve as a wrapper. I will call this function in an automated test and provide feedback on the outcome.

LLM RESPONSE:
To optimize the `pLayer_hls` function for latency, we can apply loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations and thus decrease the overall latency. Since the inner loop has a fixed number of iterations (8), we can fully unroll it. This will allow the operations within the loop to be executed in parallel, reducing the latency at the cost of increased resource utilization.

Here is the modified code:

```c
void pLayer_hls(block_t block)
{
  unsigned char i;
  unsigned char j;
  unsigned char indexVal;
  unsigned char andVal;
  block_t initial;
  copyBlock_hls(block, initial);
  for (i = 0; i < 8; i++)
  {
    block[i] = 0;
    #pragma hls_unroll yes
    for (j = 0; j < 8; j++)
    {
      indexVal = (4 * (i % 2)) + (3 - (j >> 1));
      andVal = (8 >> (i >> 1)) << ((j % 2) << 2);
      block[i] |= ((initial[indexVal] & andVal) != 0) << j;
    }
  }
}

void pLayer(block_t *block)
{
  pLayer_hls(*block);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Loop Unrolling**: The inner loop (`for (j = 0; j < 8; j++)`) is fully unrolled using `#pragma hls_unroll yes`. This means that all 8 iterations of the loop will be executed in parallel, reducing the latency significantly.
- **Latency Optimization**: By unrolling the loop, the operations within the loop are executed concurrently, which reduces the number of clock cycles required to complete the function, thus optimizing for latency.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: The latency should be reduced as the loop iterations are executed in parallel.
- **Area**: The area will increase due to the parallel execution of the loop iterations, but this is a trade-off for the reduced latency.

This modification should improve the latency of the `pLayer_hls` function while maintaining its original functionality.

LLM RESPONSE:
To further optimize the `pLayer_hls` function for latency, we can explore additional techniques such as **pipelining** the outer loop. Pipelining allows the loop iterations to overlap, which can improve throughput and potentially reduce latency further. Since the inner loop is already fully unrolled, pipelining the outer loop can help in overlapping the execution of different iterations of the outer loop.

Here is the updated code:

```c
void pLayer_hls(block_t block)
{
  unsigned char i;
  unsigned char j;
  unsigned char indexVal;
  unsigned char andVal;
  block_t initial;
  copyBlock_hls(block, initial);

  #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
  for (i = 0; i < 8; i++)
  {
    block[i] = 0;
    #pragma hls_unroll yes
    for (j = 0; j < 8; j++)
    {
      indexVal = (4 * (i % 2)) + (3 - (j >> 1));
      andVal = (8 >> (i >> 1)) << ((j % 2) << 2);
      block[i] |= ((initial[indexVal] & andVal) != 0) << j;
    }
  }
}

void pLayer(block_t *block)
{
  pLayer_hls(*block);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Pipelining the Outer Loop**: The outer loop (`for (i = 0; i < 8; i++)`) is pipelined with an initiation interval of 1 (`#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1`). This means that a new iteration of the outer loop can start every clock cycle, overlapping the execution of multiple iterations.
- **Inner Loop Unrolling**: The inner loop remains fully unrolled (`#pragma hls_unroll yes`), ensuring that all 8 iterations are executed in parallel.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: The latency may be further reduced due to the overlapping execution of the outer loop iterations.
- **Throughput**: The throughput should improve as the pipelining allows new iterations to start every clock cycle.
- **Area**: The area may increase slightly due to the additional resources required for pipelining, but this is a trade-off for improved latency and throughput.

### Synthesis Report Expectations:
- **Latency**: Should be lower than the previous result of 15.0.
- **Throughput**: Should be higher than the previous result of 18.0.
- **Area**: May increase slightly, but the focus is on optimizing latency and throughput.

This modification should further improve the performance of the `pLayer_hls` function while maintaining its original functionality.

LLM RESPONSE:
The current design has achieved significant improvements in latency (8.0) and throughput (11.0), but there is still room for further optimization. To push the limits, we can explore **partial unrolling** of the outer loop while keeping the inner loop fully unrolled. This approach balances resource utilization and performance by reducing the number of iterations of the outer loop while maintaining parallelism.

Here is the updated code:

```c
void pLayer_hls(block_t block)
{
  unsigned char i;
  unsigned char j;
  unsigned char indexVal;
  unsigned char andVal;
  block_t initial;
  copyBlock_hls(block, initial);

  #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
  #pragma hls_unroll factor=2
  for (i = 0; i < 8; i++)
  {
    block[i] = 0;
    #pragma hls_unroll yes
    for (j = 0; j < 8; j++)
    {
      indexVal = (4 * (i % 2)) + (3 - (j >> 1));
      andVal = (8 >> (i >> 1)) << ((j % 2) << 2);
      block[i] |= ((initial[indexVal] & andVal) != 0) << j;
    }
  }
}

void pLayer(block_t *block)
{
  pLayer_hls(*block);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Partial Unrolling of Outer Loop**: The outer loop (`for (i = 0; i < 8; i++)`) is partially unrolled with a factor of 2 (`#pragma hls_unroll factor=2`). This means that two iterations of the outer loop will be executed in parallel, reducing the number of iterations from 8 to 4.
- **Pipelining**: The outer loop is still pipelined with an initiation interval of 1 (`#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1`), allowing new iterations to start every clock cycle.
- **Inner Loop Unrolling**: The inner loop remains fully unrolled (`#pragma hls_unroll yes`), ensuring that all 8 iterations are executed in parallel.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: The latency should be further reduced due to the partial unrolling of the outer loop, which reduces the number of iterations.
- **Throughput**: The throughput should improve as the partial unrolling allows more parallelism in the outer loop.
- **Area**: The area may increase slightly due to the additional resources required for partial unrolling, but this is a trade-off for improved latency and throughput.

### Synthesis Report Expectations:
- **Latency**: Should be lower than the previous result of 8.0.
- **Throughput**: Should be higher than the previous result of 11.0.
- **Area**: May increase slightly, but the focus is on optimizing latency and throughput.

This modification should further improve the performance of the `pLayer_hls` function while maintaining its original functionality.

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

LLM RESPONSE:
Since the current design has achieved a latency of 8.0 and a throughput of 11.0, and further attempts to partially unroll the outer loop did not yield improvements, we can explore **fully unrolling the outer loop** to maximize parallelism. This will eliminate the outer loop entirely, allowing all iterations to execute in parallel. While this will significantly increase resource utilization, it should further reduce latency.

### Explanation:
- **Fully Unrolling the Outer Loop**: The outer loop (`for (i = 0; i < 8; i++)`) is fully unrolled using `#pragma hls_unroll yes`. This eliminates the loop entirely, allowing all 8 iterations to execute in parallel.
- **Inner Loop Unrolling**: The inner loop remains fully unrolled (`#pragma hls_unroll yes`), ensuring that all 8 iterations are executed in parallel.

### Expected Impact:

- **Throughput**: The throughput should improve, as the fully unrolled design allows all operations to execute concurrently.
- **Area**: The area will increase significantly due to the fully unrolled design, but this is a trade-off for the reduced latency.

### Synthesis Report Expectations:
- **Latency**: Should be lower than the previous result of 8.0.
- **Throughput**: Should be higher than the previous result of 11.0.
- **Area**: Will increase significantly, but the focus is on optimizing latency and throughput.

This modification should push the performance of the `pLayer_hls` function to its limits while maintaining its original functionality.

LLM RESPONSE:
The current design has achieved **0.0 latency** and **2.0 throughput**, which is an excellent result. However, the area has increased significantly, and the synthesis report indicates that the design is now using **100% of the available registers**. This suggests that the fully unrolled design is highly resource-intensive.

To improve the solution further, we need to **balance resource utilization and performance**. Since the latency is already at its theoretical minimum (0.0), we can focus on **reducing area while maintaining the same latency and throughput**. One way to achieve this is by **reducing the unrolling factor** of the outer loop while keeping the inner loop fully unrolled. This will reduce resource usage without significantly impacting performance.

```

### Explanation:
- **Partial Unrolling of Outer Loop**: The outer loop (`for (i = 0; i < 8; i++)`) is partially unrolled with a factor of 4 (`#pragma hls_unroll factor=4`). This means that 4 iterations of the outer loop will be executed in parallel, reducing the number of iterations from 8 to 2.
- **Inner Loop Unrolling**: The inner loop remains fully unrolled (`#pragma hls_unroll yes`), ensuring that all 8 iterations are executed in parallel.
- **Pipelining Removed**: Since the outer loop is partially unrolled, pipelining is not necessary.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: Should remain at 0.0, as the design is still highly parallel.
- **Throughput**: Should remain at 2.0, as the design is still highly parallel.
- **Area**: Should decrease significantly, as the partial unrolling reduces resource usage compared to full unrolling.

### Synthesis Report Expectations:
- **Latency**: Should remain at 0.0.
- **Throughput**: Should remain at 2.0.
- **Area**: Should decrease significantly, improving resource utilization.

This modification should reduce the area while maintaining the same latency and throughput, achieving a better balance between performance and resource usage.

        The current problem is:" 
 $PROJECT_HOME/tmp_present80_encryptBlock/present80_encryptBlock_initial.c(98): Unsupported synthesis feature 'pointers-to-arrays on the interface' (CIN-70)

You can get rid of pointers in the interface using the array notation like

void foo(int a[SIZE]);

you will need to substitute SIZE with the size of the array. 

In the usage of the parameter a you can use the array notation as well, like a[i] instead of *a[i].


        

 include a function named present80_encryptBlock that keeps the original function signature and calls the new present80_encryptBlock_hls, this will serve as a wrapper. I will call this function in an automated test and provide feedback on the outcome.

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve efficiency while maintaining correctness.
You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions.

### Explanation of Optimizations:
1. **Loop Unrolling**: The inner loop over `j` is fully unrolled using `#pragma hls_unroll yes`. This reduces the latency by executing all iterations of the loop in parallel, at the cost of increased resource usage.
2. **Pipelining**: The outer loop over `i` is pipelined with an initiation interval of 1 using `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1`. This allows the next iteration of the loop to start as soon as possible, improving throughput and reducing overall latency.

These optimizations should significantly reduce the latency of the `present80_encryptBlock_hls` function by allowing more parallel execution and reducing the number of cycles required to complete the function.

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve efficiency while maintaining correctness.
You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions.

LLM RESPONSE:
To further improve the solution, we can explore additional optimizations while keeping the focus on reducing latency. Specifically, we can:

1. **Partially unroll the outer loop** to reduce the number of iterations and allow more parallelism.
2. **Pipeline the inner loop** to improve throughput and reduce latency further.

Here’s the updated code:

```c
void present80_encryptBlock_hls(block_t block, present_key_t key)
{
  keys_t roundKeys;
  unsigned char i;
  unsigned char j;
  generateRoundKeys80_hls(key, roundKeys);

  #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
  for (i = 0; i < (ROUNDS - 1); i++)
  {
    addRoundKey_hls(block, roundKeys[i]);

    #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
    #pragma hls_unroll yes
    for (j = 0; j < PRESENT_BLOCK_SIZE_BYTES; j++)
    {
      block[j] = (sBox[block[j] >> 4] << 4) | sBox[block[j] & 0xF];
    }

    pLayer_hls(block);
  }

  addRoundKey_hls(block, roundKeys[ROUNDS - 1]);
}

void present80_encryptBlock(block_t *block, present_key_t *key)
{
  block_t block_copy;
  present_key_t key_copy;
  copyBlock_hls(*block, block_copy);
  copyKey_hls(*key, key_copy);
  present80_encryptBlock_hls(block_copy, key_copy);
  copyBlock_hls(block_copy, *block);
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Pipelining the Inner Loop**: The inner loop over `j` is now pipelined with an initiation interval of 1 (`#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1`). This allows the operations within the loop to execute in parallel, reducing the overall latency.
2. **Fully Unrolling the Inner Loop**: The inner loop is still fully unrolled (`#pragma hls_unroll yes`), which ensures that all iterations of the loop execute in parallel, further reducing latency.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: The pipelining of the inner loop should reduce the latency by allowing more parallelism within each iteration of the outer loop.
- **Area**: The area may increase slightly due to the additional resources required for pipelining and unrolling, but the focus is on reducing latency.

This solution should provide a better balance between latency and area compared to the previous version. Let me know if further refinements are needed!

LLM RESPONSE:
To further improve the solution, we need to explore more aggressive optimizations while maintaining correctness. Let's focus on reducing latency by:

1. **Fully unrolling the outer loop** to eliminate loop overhead and enable maximum parallelism.
2. **Pipelining the inner loop** to ensure that operations within the inner loop execute efficiently.

Here’s the updated code:

```c
void present80_encryptBlock_hls(block_t block, present_key_t key)
{
  keys_t roundKeys;
  unsigned char i;
  unsigned char j;
  generateRoundKeys80_hls(key, roundKeys);

  #pragma hls_unroll yes
  for (i = 0; i < (ROUNDS - 1); i++)
  {
    addRoundKey_hls(block, roundKeys[i]);

    #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
    #pragma hls_unroll yes
    for (j = 0; j < PRESENT_BLOCK_SIZE_BYTES; j++)
    {
      block[j] = (sBox[block[j] >> 4] << 4) | sBox[block[j] & 0xF];
    }

    pLayer_hls(block);
  }

  addRoundKey_hls(block, roundKeys[ROUNDS - 1]);
}

void present80_encryptBlock(block_t *block, present_key_t *key)
{
  block_t block_copy;
  present_key_t key_copy;
  copyBlock_hls(*block, block_copy);
  copyKey_hls(*key, key_copy);
  present80_encryptBlock_hls(block_copy, key_copy);
  copyBlock_hls(block_copy, *block);
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Fully Unrolling the Outer Loop**: The outer loop over `i` is now fully unrolled (`#pragma hls_unroll yes`). This eliminates loop overhead and allows all iterations of the outer loop to execute in parallel, significantly reducing latency.
2. **Pipelining the Inner Loop**: The inner loop over `j` is pipelined with an initiation interval of 1 (`#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1`), ensuring efficient execution of operations within the loop.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: Fully unrolling the outer loop should drastically reduce latency by enabling maximum parallelism across all rounds.
- **Area**: The area will increase significantly due to the full unrolling of the outer loop, but this is acceptable given the focus on latency reduction.

This solution should provide a significant improvement in latency compared to the previous versions. Let me know if further refinements are needed!

LLM RESPONSE:
Given that the current optimizations have not yet improved latency, throughput, or area, we need to explore alternative strategies. Let's focus on **partial unrolling** of the outer loop and **pipelining** to strike a balance between resource usage and performance. Here's the updated solution:

```

### Key Changes:
1. **Pipelining the Outer Loop**: The outer loop over `i` is pipelined with an initiation interval of 1 (`#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1`). This allows the next iteration of the loop to start as soon as possible, improving throughput and reducing latency.
2. **Fully Unrolling the Inner Loop**: The inner loop over `j` is fully unrolled (`#pragma hls_unroll yes`), enabling all iterations of the loop to execute in parallel. This reduces latency at the cost of increased resource usage.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: Pipelining the outer loop should reduce latency by overlapping iterations of the loop.
- **Throughput**: The initiation interval of 1 ensures that the loop can start a new iteration every cycle, improving throughput.
- **Area**: The area will increase due to full unrolling of the inner loop, but this is necessary for latency reduction.

### Alternative Approach:
If the above solution does not yield significant improvements, we can try **partial unrolling** of the outer loop to reduce resource usage while still improving performance. Here's an alternative version:

}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Partial Unrolling of the Outer Loop**: The outer loop over `i` is partially unrolled with a factor of 4 (`#pragma hls_unroll factor=4`). This reduces the number of iterations while keeping resource usage manageable.
2. **Fully Unrolling the Inner Loop**: The inner loop over `j` is fully unrolled (`#pragma hls_unroll yes`), ensuring maximum parallelism within each iteration of the outer loop.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: Partial unrolling of the outer loop reduces the number of iterations, improving latency.
- **Throughput**: Pipelining with an initiation interval of 1 ensures high throughput.
- **Area**: Partial unrolling reduces resource usage compared to full unrolling, making this solution more area-efficient.

System Prompt:  You are an expert in C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS), operating as an autonomous agent in a feedback-driven environment. 
Your task is to optimize synthesizable HLS code while preserving its original functionality. 
Modify only the specified functions for optimization without altering their logic. Optimization should be tailored for either throughput or latency as instructed.

Optimization mechanisms include loop unrolling and pipelining. 
Use #pragma hls_unroll X to unroll loops with a factor of X, setting X to yes for full unrolling, which reduces latency at the cost of area and throughput. 
Use #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval X to pipeline loops, where X defines the initiation interval and 0 disables pipelining. 
Pipelining increases throughput at the cost of latency. If no optimization is required, rewrite the original function without modifications.

Output the modified code within ``` tags for automated processing. 
Expect iterative refinement based on feedback and adjust the output accordingly to improve efficiency while maintaining correctness.
You will be iteratively asked to produce multiple solutions, explore different efforts to provide a good range of solutions.

void present80_encryptBlock_hls(block_t block, present_key_t key)
{
  keys_t roundKeys;
  unsigned char i;
  unsigned char j;
  generateRoundKeys80_hls(key, roundKeys);

  #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
  for (i = 0; i < (ROUNDS - 1); i++)
  {
    addRoundKey_hls(block, roundKeys[i]);

    #pragma hls_unroll yes
    for (j = 0; j < PRESENT_BLOCK_SIZE_BYTES; j++)
    {
      block[j] = (sBox[block[j] >> 4] << 4) | sBox[block[j] & 0xF];
    }

    pLayer_hls(block);
  }

  addRoundKey_hls(block, roundKeys[ROUNDS - 1]);
}

void present80_encryptBlock(block_t *block, present_key_t *key)
{
  block_t block_copy;
  present_key_t key_copy;
  copyBlock_hls(*block, block_copy);
  copyKey_hls(*key, key_copy);
  present80_encryptBlock_hls(block_copy, key_copy);
  copyBlock_hls(block_copy, *block);
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Reduced Initiation Interval**: The outer loop is pipelined with an initiation interval of 1 (`#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1`), ensuring that iterations start every cycle.
2. **Fully Unrolled Inner Loop**: The inner loop is fully unrolled (`#pragma hls_unroll yes`), enabling maximum parallelism within each iteration of the outer loop.

### Expected Impact:
- **Latency**: The reduced initiation interval and full unrolling should significantly reduce latency.
- **Throughput**: The initiation interval of 1 ensures high throughput.
- **Area**: The area will increase due to full unrolling, but this is necessary for performance improvements.

Let me know if further refinements are needed!

 include a function named present80_encryptBlock that keeps the original function signature and calls the new present80_encryptBlock_hls, this will serve as a wrapper. I will call this function in an automated test and provide feedback on the outcome.

The synthesizable function names have an extras posfix _hls. Use this name to refer to the function in the optimization process indexing the options starting from 0.
The throughput is expressed in period, the lower the better.

The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions.
This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function.
Different options use different unrolling and pipelining factors. 

The goal is to minimize the latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 70000.

This is a slight increase in latency compared to the previous configuration (1666), but the area has increased slightly as well. This suggests that the `pLayer_hls` option 2 did not provide the expected latency reduction and may not be the optimal choice.

Given that the area is still far below the target of 70000, I will now explore a more aggressive optimization strategy by increasing the unrolling factor in `copyBlock_hls` and `addRoundKey_hls` to further reduce latency while increasing the area closer to the target.
