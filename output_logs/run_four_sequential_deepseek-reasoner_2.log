Use the function names as provided, indexing the options starting from 0
The throughput is expressed in period, the lower the better.

The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions.
This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function.
Different options use different unrolling and pipelining factors. 

The goal is to minimize the latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 4000.

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='ee14e8db-2a4d-48c7-be5a-d4442edfc4d7', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='synthesis: odd_factorial 0, fibonacci 0, even_sum 2, compute4 0', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning_content='Okay, let\'s start by understanding the problem. The goal is to optimize a C application using HLS, minimizing latency while keeping the total area close to 4000. The functions involved are odd_factorial, fibonacci, even_sum, compute4, and main. Each function has several options with different area and latency values.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the given options. Let\'s look at each function\'s options:\n\nFor odd_factorial, all options have the same area (3696.9) and latency (2.0). So choosing any of them won\'t affect the area or latency differently. Similarly, fibonacci\'s options are all the same: area 1640.9, latency 2.0. \n\nThe even_sum function has two types of options. The first two options have lower area (1349.7) but higher latency (2.0). The next three options have higher area (3014.2) but lower latency (1.0). This seems like a trade-off between area and latency here. \n\nCompute4\'s options are all the same: area 8098.5 and latency 5.0. So again, choosing any option here won\'t make a difference in their individual metrics.\n\nNow, the total area target is 4000. But looking at the compute4 function alone, each option has an area of 8098.5, which already exceeds the target. Wait, that\'s a problem. How is compute4\'s area so much higher than the target? Maybe the area for compute4 includes the child functions. The problem statement says that the values reported for a function are obtained by synthesizing it in isolation, including the child functions. So compute4\'s area includes the areas of odd_factorial, fibonacci, and two even_sum instances. \n\nLet me check: The area of compute4 is 8098.5. Let\'s see if that\'s the sum of its children. For example, if odd_factorial is 3696.9, fibonacci 1640.9, and two even_sum at 1349.7 each (the lower area option), then total would be 3696.9 + 1640.9 + 2*1349.7 = 3696.9+1640.9=5337.8 + 2699.4=8037.2. But compute4\'s area is 8098.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe there\'s some overhead. So compute4\'s area is already way over the 4000 target. But the user wants the total area as close as possible to 4000. This suggests that there\'s a mistake in my understanding. Wait, maybe the areas of the child functions are not added when the parent is synthesized. The problem statement says, "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So the area of compute4 as given (8098.5) already includes all the child functions. So the total area of the entire application would be the area of the top function, which is main. But main\'s options are not listed. Wait, the problem says the functions are main, compute4, etc. The options given include compute4, but main\'s options are not listed. Wait, looking back: the application\'s functions are listed as odd_factorial, fibonacci, even_sum, compute4, main. The options provided are for odd_factorial (5 options), fibonacci (5), even_sum (5), compute4 (5). But main\'s options aren\'t listed. The call graph shows main calling compute4 and printf. So perhaps main\'s area is not considered, or maybe the top function is compute4? Hmm, this needs clarification, but given the data, maybe the total area is the sum of all functions\' individual areas, but that doesn\'t make sense because compute4 already includes its children. Wait, no. The problem states that when a function is synthesized, it includes the child functions. So if I select options for compute4, which includes its children, then the total area would be compute4\'s area (which already includes its children) plus main\'s area. But main\'s options are not provided. The problem statement\'s example lists main as part of the call graph but doesn\'t provide options for it. Therefore, perhaps the main function is not part of the optimization and its area is negligible or fixed. Therefore, the total area we need to consider is the area of compute4, since it\'s the top function being synthesized, and it includes all its children (odd_factorial, fibonacci, even_sum x2). Wait, compute4\'s area is 8098.5, which is way over the target of 4000. That suggests that the target might not be achievable. But maybe I\'m misunderstanding something. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nWait, the target is to keep the total area as close as possible to 4000. The compute4 function\'s area is 8098.5 in all options, which is more than double the target. That seems impossible. Maybe there\'s a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the area numbers for each function are per instance. For example, compute4\'s area is 8098.5, but perhaps that includes all the child functions. Let\'s check: if compute4\'s area is 8098.5, and the child functions are included, then that\'s the total area when compute4 is synthesized. So the entire application\'s area would be compute4\'s area plus main\'s area, but main\'s area isn\'t given. However, the problem says the goal is to have the total area as close as possible to 4000, but compute4\'s area alone is already 8098.5. That\'s a problem. Unless there\'s a misunderstanding here. Maybe the area numbers provided for each function are their own area, and when they are called by a parent function, the parent\'s area includes the child\'s area. Wait, the problem statement says: "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So, when a function is synthesized, it includes the child functions. Therefore, the area reported for compute4 (8098.5) already includes the areas of odd_factorial, fibonacci, and the two even_sum instances. Therefore, the total area of the application would be compute4\'s area plus main\'s area. But main\'s options aren\'t provided. However, the problem mentions that the target is 4000. So perhaps the compute4\'s area must be as close as possible to 4000. That would make more sense, but compute4\'s current options are all 8098.5. That\'s way over. So this suggests that perhaps the numbers provided have an error. Alternatively, maybe the user intended for the sum of the individual functions\' areas (without considering hierarchy) to be close to 4000. But that seems unlikely given the problem description.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the options for the functions are per instance, and when compute4 is synthesized, it includes multiple instances of even_sum. Wait, compute4 calls even_sum twice. So if even_sum\'s area is 1349.7 for options 0 and 1, then two instances would be 2699.4. Adding odd_factorial (3696.9) and fibonacci (1640.9), total would be 3696.9 + 1640.9 + 2699.4 = 8037.2. But compute4\'s area is reported as 8098.5. Close but not exact. So maybe compute4\'s area is the sum of the children\'s areas plus some overhead. But even then, compute4\'s area is way over the target. So how can we get the total area close to 4000? That\'s impossible with the current options. Unless there\'s a way to choose different options for the child functions to reduce the overall area. Wait, but compute4\'s options are fixed? Wait no, the problem says that each function has its own options, and when you select a different option for a child function, it affects the parent\'s outcome. So compute4\'s area and latency are dependent on the options selected for its children. Wait, but in the given data, the options for compute4 are all the same. Let me recheck:\n\nOptions for compute4: all have area 8098.5, latency 5.0, throughput 6.0. So perhaps the compute4\'s options are fixed, regardless of the child options. That can\'t be. But the problem states that "selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function." So maybe the options for compute4 are different based on the options selected for the child functions. Wait, but in the data provided, compute4\'s options are all the same. That\'s confusing. Maybe the options for compute4 are different based on how the child functions are optimized. For example, if we choose different options for even_sum, that could change compute4\'s area and latency. But according to the data given, compute4\'s options are fixed regardless of child functions. That seems contradictory. \n\nWait, the problem statement says: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when you synthesize compute4 in isolation, it uses the best latency options for its children (odd_factorial, fibonacci, even_sum). But when you select different options for the child functions, the parent function\'s area and latency may change. However, the data provided lists the options for each function, implying that each function\'s options are independent. For example, even_sum has options 0-4, and when you select option 0 for even_sum, it uses that option\'s area and latency. So the compute4\'s area and latency depend on the options selected for its children. But in the provided data, compute4\'s options are all the same. That suggests that regardless of the child options, compute4\'s area and latency remain the same. That doesn\'t make sense. Therefore, perhaps the data provided is structured such that each function\'s options are independent, and the parent function\'s options are separate. So for compute4, regardless of which child options are chosen, compute4\'s own options (0-4) have fixed area and latency. That doesn\'t align with the problem statement. So perhaps the data provided is incorrect or incomplete. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compute4\'s options are different based on how the children are configured, but the user has not provided that information. This is a problem. Given the data as presented, compute4\'s area is fixed at 8098.5 for all options, which is way above the target of 4000. That makes the problem impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here. \n\nWait, perhaps the area for compute4 is not the sum of the children\'s areas. Maybe it\'s the area of the compute4 function itself, not including the children. But the problem statement says that the area reported for a function includes the child functions. So compute4\'s area includes the children\'s areas. Therefore, the compute4\'s area is 8098.5, which is the total area including children. But then how can we get close to 4000? It\'s impossible unless there\'s a mistake in the data. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the target area of 4000 is per function, but that\'s not what the problem states. The problem says "total area as close as possible to a target value". So the sum of all functions\' areas? But compute4\'s area already includes the children. So the total area would be compute4\'s area (including children) plus main\'s area. But main\'s area isn\'t given. \n\nThis suggests that there\'s a misunderstanding or an error in the problem setup. However, given the data as provided, we need to proceed. \n\nLet\'s consider that the target area is 4000, and the compute4\'s area is 8098.5 in all options. That\'s way over. Therefore, the only way to get closer to the target is to reduce the area of the child functions. Wait, but the child functions\' options are fixed. For example, odd_factorial\'s area is 3696.9 for all options. That\'s already higher than 4000 alone. So this seems impossible. \n\nWait, perhaps there\'s a mistake in the way the data is presented. Let me recheck the options:\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nFor odd_factorial, all 5 options have area 3696.9. So no way to reduce that.\n\nFibonacci\'s options all have area 1640.9. Even if we could choose lower area options, but all options are same.\n\neven_sum has options with area 1349.7 (options 0,1) and 3014.2 (options 2,3,4). So choosing options 0 or 1 would give lower area for even_sum.\n\nBut compute4 calls even_sum twice. So if we choose even_sum options 0 or 1, each instance is 1349.7, so two instances would be 2699.4. Adding odd_factorial (3696.9) and fibonacci (1640.9) gives total area 3696.9 + 1640.9 + 2699.4 = 8037.2. But compute4\'s area is reported as 8098.5. Close, but still way over 4000. So even if we choose the lower area options for even_sum, the total area would still be around 8000+. \n\nThis suggests that the target area of 4000 is impossible to reach with the given options. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to minimize latency while keeping the area as close as possible to 4000, but given the data, the best we can do is to choose the options with the lowest latency. \n\nBut the problem requires a balance between latency and area. Since all options for compute4 have the same latency (5.0), but the child functions\' options can affect compute4\'s latency. Wait, the problem says that the compute4\'s options have latency 5.0, but perhaps the actual latency of compute4 depends on the child functions\' latencies. For example, if the child functions have lower latency, compute4\'s latency could be lower. But according to the data provided, compute4\'s options have fixed latency regardless of child options. That\'s confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the latency of compute4 is the sum of the child functions\' latencies. For example, compute4\'s latency is 5.0, but if the child functions have lower latency, compute4\'s latency could be reduced. But according to the given data, compute4\'s latency is fixed. This is unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compute4\'s latency is determined by the sum of the latencies of its child functions. For example, if each child function has a certain latency, compute4\'s latency is the sum. But according to the given data, compute4\'s latency is 5.0 regardless of the child options. So this is confusing. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed step by step. Let\'s start by synthesizing a configuration to get actual data. For example, choose the lowest area options for even_sum (options 0 or 1) and see what the total area and latency are. \n\nThe first step is to choose a configuration and synthesize it. Let\'s try selecting the lowest area options for even_sum to minimize area. \n\nThe initial configuration could be:\n\nodd_factorial: any option (since all are same)\nfibonacci: any option\neven_sum: option 0 (area 1349.7)\ncompute4: any option (since all are same)\n\nBut since compute4\'s options are all the same, maybe the parent\'s latency and area depend on the child options. However, according to the given data, compute4\'s area is 8098.5 regardless. That\'s contradictory. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area and latency reported for each function\'s option are when that function is synthesized with its children. So, for example, when you select option 0 for compute4, it may correspond to certain options for its children. But the data provided for compute4\'s options all have the same area and latency. \n\nThis is unclear. Given the data, perhaps the compute4\'s options are fixed, and the child functions\' options can be varied. But how does that affect the total area and latency?\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to start by inspecting some options to clarify. For example, inspect the options for even_sum to see their area and latency, then compute the possible total area. \n\nWait, the inspect command allows us to see the options of functions. The user provided the options already, but maybe the inspect command can confirm. For example, inspect even_sum\'s options to verify their area and latency. But the user already listed them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compute4\'s area is the sum of the areas of the child functions plus its own logic. If that\'s the case, and if we can reduce the child functions\' areas, the total area of compute4 would decrease. But according to the data, even_sum\'s options 0 and 1 have lower area. So maybe if we select even_sum\'s options 0 or 1, the total area of compute4 would be 3696.9 (odd_factorial) + 1640.9 (fibonacci) + 2 * 1349.7 (even_sum) = 8037.2, which is close to the compute4\'s reported area of 8098.5. Maybe there\'s some overhead. \n\nSo, the total area would be around 8037.2. But that\'s still way over 4000. So how can we get close to 4000? It\'s impossible unless there\'s a misunderstanding. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the target area is 4000 for each function. But that doesn\'t make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to select options for the functions such that the sum of their individual areas (not considering hierarchy) is close to 4000. For example, odd_factorial\'s area is 3696.9, which is already over. So again, impossible. \n\nThis suggests that there\'s a mistake in the problem setup. However, given the data as provided, perhaps the way to proceed is to focus on minimizing latency, since area can\'t be reduced enough. \n\nLooking at the even_sum function, options 2-4 have lower latency (1.0) but higher area. If we choose those, the latency of compute4 might be reduced. But compute4\'s latency is 5.0 in all options. So this doesn\'t make sense. \n\nAlternatively, the compute4\'s latency might be the sum of the latencies of its children. Let\'s see: compute4 calls odd_factorial (latency 2.0), fibonacci (2.0), and two even_sum (each 2.0 or 1.0). So total latency could be 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 =8, but compute4\'s latency is reported as 5.0. That doesn\'t add up. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the functions are called in parallel, so the latency is the maximum of the children\'s latencies. For example, if all children have latency 2.0, compute4\'s latency is 2.0. But according to the data, compute4\'s latency is 5.0. So that doesn\'t fit. \n\nThis is confusing. Given the data provided, perhaps the best approach is to try to minimize latency by selecting the fastest options for each function, even if it increases area. But since the area is already way over the target, maybe the solution is to find the configuration with the lowest latency, accepting that the area is over the target. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the area can be reduced by selecting lower area options for even_sum, but even then, the total area is still too high. \n\nBut given the problem\'s instruction, perhaps the agent needs to explore different configurations. \n\nFirst, since all functions except even_sum have fixed area and latency regardless of their options, the only variation comes from even_sum\'s options. So the only decision is which even_sum options to choose. \n\neven_sum has options with lower area (1349.7) and higher latency (2.0) or higher area (3014.2) and lower latency (1.0). \n\nIf we choose the lower latency options (options 2-4) for even_sum, the latency of compute4 might decrease. But according to compute4\'s data, latency is 5.0. So maybe the compute4\'s latency is fixed, but that\'s not logical. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compute4\'s latency is influenced by the children\'s latency. For example, if even_sum\'s latency is 1.0, then compute4\'s latency might be reduced. But according to the given data, compute4\'s latency is always 5.0. \n\nThis suggests that the data provided is incorrect or incomplete. However, given the data, the only variable function is even_sum. So the first step is to synthesize a configuration with even_sum using lower latency options (options 2-4) and see if that reduces compute4\'s latency. \n\nBut how to proceed? The user wants the first action. The options are to synthesize, inspect, run a Python script, profile, or accept a solution. \n\nSince we don\'t have any synthesis results yet, the first step is to synthesize a configuration. Let\'s choose even_sum\'s option 2 (higher area, lower latency) and see if that affects compute4\'s latency. \n\nSo, the first synthesis command would be:\n\nsynthesis: odd_factorial 0, fibonacci 0, even_sum 2, compute4 0\n\nWait, but according to the data, compute4\'s options are all the same. So selecting any compute4 option is the same. \n\nBut maybe the compute4\'s options are dependent on the child functions\' options. For example, compute4\'s options may correspond to different pipelining or unrolling factors. However, the data shows all compute4\'s options have the same area and latency. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compute4\'s options are fixed, and the child options determine the overall area and latency. \n\nIn any case, the first step is to try a synthesis with even_sum using option 2 and see what the results are. \n\nTherefore, the first action would be to synthesize a configuration with even_sum using option 2. \n\nSo the reply would be:\n\nsynthesis: odd_factorial 0, fibonacci 0, even_sum 2, compute4 0\n\nBut why compute4 0? Because all options are the same, so it doesn\'t matter. \n\nAlternatively, maybe compute4\'s options affect how the child functions are called. For example, if compute4 is unrolled or pipelined. But the data shows no variation. \n\nThis is confusing, but given the data, the best first step is to try to synthesize a configuration with even_sum\'s higher latency option and see the results.'))], created=1740856586, model='deepseek-reasoner', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_5417b77867_prod0225', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4858, prompt_tokens=1142, total_tokens=6000, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 1088}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 4834}, prompt_cache_hit_tokens=1088, prompt_cache_miss_tokens=54))

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='a6db093f-8a9b-4122-8737-69618cddc56d', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='synthesis: odd_factorial 0, fibonacci 0, even_sum 0, compute4 0', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning_content='Okay, let me start by understanding the problem. The user is trying to optimize a C application using HLS with the goal of minimizing latency while keeping the total area close to 4000. The previous synthesis attempt resulted in a total area of 8098.5, which is way over the target. The functions involved are odd_factorial, fibonacci, even_sum, and compute4.\n\nLooking at the options provided, the functions odd_factorial and fibonacci have multiple options, but all their options have the same area and latency. So changing their options won\'t affect the area or latency. The even_sum function has options with different areas and latencies. The first two options have lower area (1349.7) but higher latency (2.0), while options 2, 3, and 4 have higher area (3014.2) but lower latency (1.0). The compute4 function\'s options all have the same high area (8098.5) regardless of the option chosen.\n\nThe previous configuration used even_sum option 2, which has higher area. The compute4\'s area is already 8098.5, which is the main contributor to exceeding the target area of 4000. But wait, the compute4\'s area is fixed across all options, which is confusing. Maybe compute4\'s area includes the sum of its child functions? Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nAh, the problem says: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when compute4 is synthesized, it includes the child functions (odd_factorial, fibonacci, even_sum, even_sum). So the area for compute4 is the sum of its own area plus the areas of its children. Wait, no—the problem says that the area values given for each function option already include the child functions. So each compute4 option\'s area (8098.5) is the total when synthesized with the best child options. Wait, but the user wants the total area to be close to 4000, but even the compute4 alone is 8098.5. That seems impossible. This suggests that the area values listed for each function option are the total areas when synthesized with their children. So if compute4\'s option 0 has an area of 8098.5, that\'s the total area when using its children\'s best options. Therefore, the previous synthesis\'s total area is 8098.5, which is way over 4000. The target is 4000, so this is a problem.\n\nBut how can we reduce the area? Since compute4\'s options are all 8098.5, maybe the child functions\' areas are contributing to this. Let\'s check the child functions:\n\nodd_factorial\'s area is 3696.9 per option. fibonacci is 1640.9. even_sum has options with 1349.7 or 3014.2. Since compute4 calls even_sum twice, if even_sum uses the lower area option (1349.7), then two instances would be 2*1349.7=2699.4. Then odd_factorial (3696.9) + fibonacci (1640.9) + even_sum*2 (2699.4) = total area would be 3696.9 + 1640.9 + 2699.4 = 8037.2. Wait, but compute4\'s area is reported as 8098.5. That\'s close, but maybe there\'s some overhead. So even if we choose the lowest area options for the children, compute4\'s area is still way over 4000. This suggests that the target area is impossible to meet with the current options. But maybe the user expects a different approach. Perhaps the compute4\'s area is not the sum of its children but the area of compute4 itself plus the children. Wait, the problem says that when a function is synthesized, the child functions are included. So each function\'s reported area includes the child functions. Therefore, compute4\'s area of 8098.5 already includes the areas of odd_factorial, fibonacci, and two even_sum instances. So if we choose different options for the child functions, the compute4\'s area would change. But according to the options given, the compute4\'s options all have the same area, which suggests that regardless of the child options selected, compute4\'s area remains 8098.5. That can\'t be right. There\'s a contradiction here.\n\nWait, the problem states: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when a function is synthesized, the tool selects the best (probably lowest latency) options for the child functions. Therefore, the area reported for compute4 (8098.5) is based on using the best (lowest latency) child options. But the user can choose different options for the child functions, which may have higher latency but lower area. However, the compute4\'s area would then be different. But according to the given options, compute4\'s options all have the same area and latency. That suggests that the compute4\'s options don\'t affect the area, which doesn\'t make sense. Maybe the compute4\'s options are for its own directives (like pipeline or loop unrolling), but the child functions\' options are fixed when computing compute4\'s options. But the user can choose different options for the child functions when synthesizing compute4. This is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compute4\'s area is fixed because all its options use the same child configurations. But the user can override the child configurations. So the total area would be the sum of the chosen options for all functions. For example, if compute4 is synthesized with even_sum option 0 (area 1349.7), and two instances of even_sum, then the even_sum contribution would be 2*1349.7. But the problem says that when you synthesize compute4, you have to choose an option for compute4 and options for its children. But the compute4\'s options may not directly influence the child functions. This is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of all the functions with their chosen options. For example, if compute4\'s option 0 has an area of 8098.5, but that\'s when the child functions are using their best (lowest latency) options. If the user chooses higher area options for the child functions, the total area would decrease. Wait, no—lower area options for child functions would decrease the total area. Wait, if the child functions have options with lower area, then when compute4 uses those, the total area would be lower. But according to the given options, compute4\'s area is 8098.5 regardless of its option. That seems odd. Maybe the compute4\'s area is just its own area, not including the children. But the problem statement says that the values reported include the child functions. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, the user\'s previous synthesis used compute4 option 0, even_sum option 2 (area 3014.2), and others. The total area was 8098.5. But the compute4\'s own area (if not including children) would be 8098.5, but that doesn\'t make sense. Because the even_sum option 2 has an area of 3014.2, and two instances would be 6028.4, plus odd_factorial 3696.9 and fibonacci 1640.9, the total would be 3696.9 + 1640.9 + 6028.4 = 11366.2, which is higher than 8098.5. This suggests that the compute4\'s area reported already includes the children\'s areas. Therefore, the compute4\'s area of 8098.5 is the total when using the child options that give the best latency. But the user can choose different child options that may have lower area but higher latency, which would reduce compute4\'s total area but increase its latency.\n\nTherefore, the strategy should be to select options for the child functions (odd_factorial, fibonacci, even_sum) that have lower area, even if their latency is higher, to bring the total area down closer to 4000. However, compute4\'s latency is the sum (or some combination) of the child latencies. The compute4\'s latency in the previous synthesis was 5.0. \n\nBut the problem states that the goal is to minimize latency while keeping the area as close as possible to 4000. The current area is 8098.5, which is way over. So the priority is to reduce the area. \n\nLooking at the child functions:\n\n- odd_factorial: All options have area 3696.9. No way to reduce this. So this function\'s area is fixed, contributing 3696.9 to the total.\n\n- fibonacci: All options area 1640.9. Fixed as well. Contributes 1640.9.\n\n- even_sum: Options 0 and 1 have area 1349.7 (higher latency 2.0), options 2-4 have area 3014.2 (lower latency 1.0). Since compute4 uses two even_sum instances, choosing even_sum option 0 or 1 would contribute 2*1349.7 = 2699.4, while options 2-4 would contribute 2*3014.2 = 6028.4. \n\nSo the total area would be odd_factorial (3696.9) + fibonacci (1640.9) + even_sum*2. \n\nIf even_sum uses option 0: 3696.9 + 1640.9 + 2699.4 = 8037.2.\n\nIf even_sum uses option 2: 3696.9 + 1640.9 + 6028.4 = 11366.2.\n\nWait, but the previous synthesis had a total area of 8098.5 when using even_sum option 2. But according to this calculation, using even_sum option 2 would result in a much higher area. This discrepancy suggests that my understanding is incorrect. The compute4\'s area is given as 8098.5 when synthesized with its child functions. So the compute4\'s area includes all the children. Therefore, if we choose even_sum options with lower area, the compute4\'s area would decrease. \n\nBut according to the given options, compute4\'s area is fixed at 8098.5 regardless of its option. That can\'t be. Therefore, the initial assumption must be wrong. Perhaps the compute4\'s options are independent of the child functions\' options. That is, when you choose a compute4 option, it uses certain optimizations, and the child functions are synthesized with their own options. But the problem states that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. \n\nThis is confusing. Let\'s re-read the problem statement:\n\n"The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function."\n\nAh, so when a function is synthesized, the tool selects the best (lowest latency) options for the child functions. Therefore, the area reported for compute4 (8098.5) is when it uses the best (lowest latency) child options. However, the user can override the child options, which may have higher latency but lower area. But when you select a different child option, the parent\'s area and latency will change. \n\nSo, for example, if the user selects even_sum option 0 (higher latency, lower area), then when compute4 is synthesized, it uses that even_sum option, leading to higher latency but lower area. However, the compute4\'s own options (0-4) might affect how it\'s synthesized (e.g., pipelining, loop unrolling), which could affect latency and area. But according to the given options, all compute4 options have the same area and latency. So changing compute4\'s option doesn\'t affect the outcome. Therefore, the only way to influence the total area and latency is by changing the options of the child functions (odd_factorial, fibonacci, even_sum).\n\nBut odd_factorial and fibonacci have all options with the same area and latency. So their options don\'t matter. The only variable is even_sum. Choosing even_sum options 0 or 1 (area 1349.7) would reduce the total area compared to options 2-4 (area 3014.2). However, using even_sum 0 would increase latency (from 1.0 to 2.0), which would affect compute4\'s latency.\n\nThe previous synthesis used even_sum option 2, which has higher area but lower latency. The compute4\'s latency was 5.0. If we switch to even_sum option 0, which has higher latency (2.0), but lower area, then compute4\'s latency might increase. Let\'s see: compute4\'s latency is 5.0 when using even_sum option 2 (latency 1.0). If even_sum\'s latency increases to 2.0, then compute4\'s latency might be higher. But how exactly is compute4\'s latency calculated? It depends on how the functions are called. The call graph shows compute4 calls odd_factorial, fibonacci, and two even_sums. If all four functions are called sequentially, then the total latency would be the sum of their individual latencies. But if there\'s pipelining or parallel execution, it could be less.\n\nIn the previous synthesis, compute4\'s latency was 5.0. The child functions\' latencies were: odd_factorial 2.0, fibonacci 2.0, even_sum 1.0 each. So sum would be 2 + 2 + 1 +1 =6, but the compute4\'s latency is 5.0. So there must be some overlap or pipelining. Therefore, the latency isn\'t simply additive. \n\nBut the key point is that using even_sum with higher latency (2.0) would likely increase compute4\'s latency. However, the area would decrease. The current area is 8098.5. If we switch even_sum to option 0 (area 1349.7), then two instances contribute 2*1349.7=2699.4. The other functions are fixed: odd_factorial 3696.9, fibonacci 1640.9. Total area would be 3696.9 + 1640.9 + 2699.4 = 8037.2, which is still way above 4000. But according to the compute4\'s area being 8098.5 when using even_sum option 2, perhaps the compute4\'s area includes its own area plus the children. But 8098.5 is less than 8037.2 (from the sum of children with even_sum 2), which doesn\'t make sense. Therefore, there\'s a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the area values provided for each function option are the incremental area added by that function, not including the children. But the problem statement says that the child functions are included. This is very confusing. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to try different configurations and see the results. Since the initial synthesis with even_sum option 2 gave a total area of 8098.5, which is way over the target, we need to find a way to reduce the area. The only way is to choose even_sum options with lower area (options 0 or 1). Let\'s try that.\n\nSo the next step would be to synthesize a configuration with even_sum option 0. Since odd_factorial and fibonacci options don\'t affect area or latency, we can leave them at 0. compute4\'s options also don\'t affect area, so leaving it at 0. \n\nTherefore, the next synthesis command would be:\n\nsynthesis: odd_factorial 0, fibonacci 0, even_sum 0, compute4 0\n\nThis will test if using even_sum option 0 reduces the total area. However, based on the previous calculation, the area would still be around 8037.2, which is still too high. But maybe the compute4\'s area isn\'t the sum of the children. Perhaps the compute4\'s area is reported as 8098.5 regardless of the child options, which would imply that the child options don\'t affect the parent\'s area. But that contradicts the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compute4\'s area is fixed, and the child functions\' areas are not included in the total. But that doesn\'t make sense. \n\nAnother possibility is that the total area is the sum of all functions\' areas with their selected options. For example, if we select even_sum 0, then each even_sum instance contributes 1349.7, and since compute4 calls two, that\'s 2*1349.7 = 2699.4. Plus odd_factorial 3696.9 and fibonacci 1640.9. Total area: 3696.9 + 1640.9 + 2699.4 = 8037.2. Which is still way over 4000. But the problem\'s target is 4000, so this seems impossible. \n\nGiven that the target is 4000 and the current total is over 8000, even with the lowest area options, it\'s impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. Perhaps the area values provided for each function are per instance, and compute4\'s area is its own plus the children. But with the given numbers, it\'s still impossible. \n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: The user says, "keeping the total area as close as possible to a target value." The target is 4000. But according to the provided options, the smallest possible area is when using even_sum options 0 or 1, which would be 1349.7 * 2 = 2699.4 for even_sum, plus 3696.9 (odd_factorial) + 1640.9 (fibonacci) = 8037.2. This is still over 4000. So there\'s a contradiction. Maybe the area values for the functions are not additive, but the compute4\'s area is the total. In the initial synthesis, compute4\'s area was 8098.5. So perhaps the total area is just the compute4\'s area, which includes all children. If that\'s the case, then changing child options would affect compute4\'s area. But according to the given options, compute4\'s area is fixed at 8098.5 regardless of option. That can\'t be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compute4\'s area is fixed, and the child functions\' areas are part of compute4\'s area. Therefore, when you change child options, compute4\'s area changes, but the given compute4 options all have the same area, which implies that the child options are fixed when synthesizing compute4. But the user can choose different child options. This is unclear.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to run a Python script using OR-Tools to model the problem as a combinatorial optimization, minimizing latency subject to the area being as close as possible to 4000. However, since the target seems unattainable, the script would find the configuration with the smallest area, even if it\'s over 4000.\n\nThe variables are the options for each function: odd_factorial (0-4), fibonacci (0-4), even_sum (0-4), compute4 (0-4). However, all options for odd_factorial and fibonacci have the same area and latency. So their options don\'t matter. even_sum has options with area 1349.7 (0-1) and 3014.2 (2-4). compute4\'s options all have area 8098.5. \n\nWait, but compute4\'s area is 8098.5 regardless of the options. If that\'s the case, then the total area is fixed at 8098.5, making it impossible to reach the target. This suggests that there\'s a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps the compute4\'s area is not the total but just its own. \n\nAssuming compute4\'s area is 8098.5, and the child functions\' areas are separate, then the total area would be compute4\'s area plus the child areas. But this is not the case, as the problem states that child functions are included in the parent\'s synthesis. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the Python script to model the problem. The script would minimize latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 4000. Since the area is way over, the script will find the configuration with the minimum possible area, which would be using even_sum options 0 or 1, and the others at their lowest area (which they already are). \n\nThe Python script using OR-Tools would need to consider the options and calculate the total area and latency. However, given the data provided:\n\n- odd_factorial and fibonacci options don\'t affect area or latency.\n- even_sum options 0-1: area 1349.7 each, latency 2.0\n- even_sum options 2-4: area 3014.2 each, latency 1.0\n- compute4\'s area is 8098.5 regardless of option, and latency 5.0.\n\nWait, the compute4\'s latency is 5.0 in the previous synthesis. How does it relate to the child latencies? If the child latencies are higher, compute4\'s latency might increase. For example, if even_sum\'s latency increases to 2.0, then compute4\'s latency might increase to 5.0 + (2.0 -1.0)*2 = 7.0? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the compute4\'s latency is determined by the sum of the child latencies plus its own overhead. If the children\'s latencies change, compute4\'s latency changes. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, when synthesizing a function, the best latency from the child functions is selected. But when the user chooses a specific child option, that overrides the best latency selection. So the parent\'s latency and area would depend on the child options chosen.\n\nBut without knowing how the parent\'s latency is computed from the children\'s, it\'s hard to model. However, given that the previous synthesis used even_sum option 2 (latency 1.0) and compute4\'s latency was 5.0, perhaps using even_sum option 0 (latency 2.0) would increase compute4\'s latency. \n\nAssuming that compute4\'s latency is the sum of the maximum latency of its children (since they might be called sequentially), then:\n\ncompute4\'s latency = max(odd_factorial latency, fibonacci latency, even_sum latency) * number of times each is called? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if the functions are called sequentially, the total latency would be the sum. But the initial compute4 latency is 5.0, which is less than the sum of 2 (odd) + 2 (fib) + 1 (even) +1 (even) =6. So perhaps there\'s pipelining.\n\nIn any case, the priority is to reduce the area. The only way is to choose even_sum options 0 or 1. So the next step is to synthesize that configuration and see the resulting area and latency.\n\nSo the next synthesis command would be:\n\nsynthesis: odd_factorial 0, fibonacci 0, even_sum 0, compute4 0\n\nThis changes even_sum to option 0 (lower area, higher latency) to see if the total area decreases.\n\nAfter running this, the user would receive a new synthesis report with the area and latency. If the area is still too high, then perhaps there\'s no solution and the answer is to use the configuration with the lowest possible area, which would be even_sum 0 or 1. Alternatively, maybe there\'s a misunderstanding in how the area is calculated.\n\nBut given the problem\'s constraints, the best approach is to proceed with this synthesis step.'))], created=1740856809, model='deepseek-reasoner', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_5417b77867_prod0225', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5121, prompt_tokens=1320, total_tokens=6441, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 1152}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 5097}, prompt_cache_hit_tokens=1152, prompt_cache_miss_tokens=168))

The user is working on optimizing a C application using HLS. Their goal is to minimize latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 4000. So far, they\'ve tried two different configurations.\n\nFirst, they synthesized with odd_factorial 0, fibonacci 0, even_sum 2, compute4 0. The total area was 8098.5, which is way over the target of 4000. The latency was 5.0. Then they tried even_sum 0 instead, which brought the area down to 4995.9, still over 4000, but latency increased to 8.0. So, the second configuration reduced area but increased latency.\n\nLooking at the options provided, the even_sum function has two types of options. Options 0 and 1 have area 1349.7 and latency 2.0, while options 2,3,4 have higher area (3014.2) but lower latency (1.0). So using even_sum 0 or 1 gives lower area but higher latency, whereas 2-4 give higher area but lower latency.\n\nThe compute4 function\'s options all have the same area and latency (8098.5 and 5.0), but in the synthesis reports, when they used compute4 0 with even_sum 0, the area was 4995.9. That might be because the compute4\'s area is influenced by its child functions. Wait, the initial options for compute4 all have area 8098.5, but the synthesis results after selecting even_sum 0 gave a total area of 4995.9. That seems contradictory. Maybe the compute4\'s area is a sum of its own area plus the child functions? Wait, the original options for compute4 are listed as area 8098.5 each. But when they synthesized with compute4 0 and even_sum 0, the total area was 4995.9. That\'s lower than compute4\'s standalone area. That doesn\'t add up. Maybe the compute4\'s area in the options is the total when synthesized with the child functions, but perhaps the child functions\' options affect the total area. Wait, the problem statement says: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when compute4 is synthesized in isolation, it includes the child functions. So the compute4\'s area of 8098.5 is when it\'s synthesized with the best child options. But when the user selects specific child options, maybe the area changes. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the user\'s first synthesis used compute4 0 with even_sum 2. The area reported was 8098.5. The second synthesis used compute4 0 with even_sum 0, resulting in a lower area of 4995.9. That suggests that when the child functions (like even_sum) are using different options, the total area of compute4 changes. But according to the initial data, compute4\'s options all have the same area. That must mean that the compute4\'s area in the options is when it\'s using the default or best child options. But when the user selects specific child options, the total area is a combination of compute4\'s options plus the selected child options. Wait, maybe the compute4\'s area is fixed regardless of the child options? That can\'t be, because changing even_sum from option 2 to 0 reduced the total area. So the compute4\'s area in the options might be its own area plus the sum of the child functions\' areas. Let me check the numbers.\n\nIn the first synthesis: compute4 0, even_sum 2. The even_sum option 2 has area 3014.2. The compute4\'s area in the options is 8098.5. But the total area reported was 8098.5. So maybe compute4\'s area includes the child functions. So when you select compute4 0, it\'s already including the area of the child functions with their best options. But when the user selects specific options for the child functions, the total area is the sum of compute4\'s area (without children) plus the selected children\'s areas. Wait, that doesn\'t fit. Alternatively, maybe the compute4\'s area is standalone, and the child functions are synthesized separately. But the problem statement says that when you synthesize a function, you include the child functions. So when you select compute4 0, that\'s a configuration where compute4 is synthesized with certain options for itself and the child functions. But the user can override the child functions\' options by specifying them. So perhaps the compute4\'s options are different implementations of compute4 itself, but when you select child options, you replace the ones used in compute4\'s synthesis.\n\nThis is a bit unclear. Let\'s try to model it. Suppose each function\'s options include the child functions. For example, compute4\'s option 0 might use odd_factorial 0, fibonacci 0, even_sum 0, even_sum 0 (since compute4 has four children: odd_factorial, fibonacci, even_sum, even_sum). But the user can override those by specifying different options for the child functions. So when the user selects compute4 0 and also specifies even_sum 2, that replaces the even_sum options used in compute4\'s synthesis. Therefore, the total area would be compute4\'s own area (from its option 0) plus the areas of the child functions with the selected options. But according to the initial data, compute4\'s options have area 8098.5 each, which might already include the child functions. But when the user selects different child options, the total area changes. So perhaps compute4\'s area in the options is when using the default child options (like even_sum 0), and when the user selects even_sum 2, the area increases. Wait, in the first synthesis, when even_sum 2 was selected, compute4\'s area was 8098.5. But even_sum 2\'s area is 3014.2. If compute4\'s area includes the children, then perhaps compute4\'s base area (without children) plus the sum of the children\'s areas. Let\'s see:\n\nIn the first case: compute4 0, odd_factorial 0 (3696.9), fibonacci 0 (1640.9), even_sum 2 (3014.2), and another even_sum 2 (3014.2). Summing these: 3696.9 + 1640.9 + 3014.2*2 = 3696.9 + 1640.9 + 6028.4 = 11365.2. But the reported area was 8098.5, which is less. So that doesn\'t add up. Alternatively, maybe compute4\'s area is the sum of its own logic plus the children\'s areas. But compute4\'s own area without children might be 8098.5 minus the sum of the default children\'s areas. Wait, but the problem statement says that the values reported for a function are obtained by synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. So compute4\'s area of 8098.5 is when it\'s synthesized with the best child options (presumably the ones that give the best latency for compute4). But when the user selects different child options, the total area would be the sum of compute4\'s own area (without children) plus the selected child options\' areas. But how do we know compute4\'s own area without children?\n\nThis is confusing. Let\'s look at the synthesis reports. The first configuration had compute4 0 and even_sum 2. The total area was 8098.5. The second configuration used compute4 0 and even_sum 0, resulting in 4995.9. So changing even_sum from 2 to 0 reduced the area by a lot. But according to the options, even_sum 2 has area 3014.2, even_sum 0 has 1349.7. The difference is 3014.2 -1349.7 = 1664.5. But the total area difference is 8098.5 -4995.9 = 3102.6. Which is roughly twice that (since compute4 calls even_sum twice). 1664.5 * 2 = 3329, which is close to the 3102.6 difference. So maybe the total area is compute4\'s own area plus the sum of the child functions\' areas. But according to the initial data, compute4\'s area is 8098.5. But when using even_sum 2 (3014.2 each), and two instances, that\'s 6028.4. Adding compute4\'s area would be 8098.5 + 6028.4 = 14126.9, which doesn\'t match the reported 8098.5. So that can\'t be. Alternatively, compute4\'s area as reported includes the child functions. So compute4\'s area of 8098.5 includes the child functions\' areas. But when the user selects a different child option, it replaces that part of the area. For example, compute4\'s default option 0 uses even_sum 0 (area 1349.7 each). So two even_sum 0s contribute 2699.4. The rest of compute4\'s area (8098.5 -2699.4 = 5399.1) is compute4\'s own logic plus odd_factorial and fibonacci. If the user selects even_sum 2 (3014.2 each), then the total area becomes 5399.1 + 2*3014.2 = 5399.1 + 6028.4 = 11427.5. But the synthesis report for the first configuration says the area was 8098.5. That doesn\'t match. So maybe the compute4\'s area in the options is a fixed value, and the child functions\' options don\'t affect it. But that contradicts the synthesis results. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options listed for each function are the area and latency when synthesized in isolation, including their children. So compute4\'s option 0 has area 8098.5, which is the total when it uses the best options for its children. But when the user selects different child options, the total area would be different. However, the problem statement says that the values reported for a function (like compute4) are obtained by synthesizing it in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. So compute4\'s area of 8098.5 is when it uses the best child options (for latency). But when the user manually selects child options, they might be worse for latency but better for area. \n\nSo the user\'s first synthesis used compute4 0 with even_sum 2. But compute4\'s option 0\'s area is 8098.5, which includes the child functions. However, even_sum 2 has a higher area (3014.2) than even_sum 0 (1349.7). So if compute4\'s default option uses even_sum 0 (for lower latency?), but the user selected even_sum 2, which has higher area but lower latency. But the first synthesis resulted in the same area as compute4\'s option 0. That suggests that selecting even_sum 2 didn\'t change the area. Which is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compute4\'s area is fixed regardless of the child options, but the child options affect the latency. But in the first synthesis, the latency was 5.0 (same as compute4\'s option 0), but when they changed even_sum to 0, the latency increased to 8.0. So the child options affect the latency of compute4. So the compute4\'s latency is the sum of its own latency plus the latencies of the child functions. Wait, compute4\'s option 0 has latency 5.0. If compute4\'s own latency is 5.0, but when using even_sum 0 (latency 2.0 each), but compute4 calls even_sum twice, then maybe the total latency is compute4\'s own latency (5.0) plus the sum of the child latencies. But that would be 5 + 2 + 2 = 9, which doesn\'t match. Or perhaps the compute4\'s latency is the sum of its own operations plus the maximum of the child latencies. For example, if compute4\'s latency is 5.0, and the child functions have latencies 2.0 (odd_factorial), 2.0 (fibonacci), 1.0 (even_sum 2), 1.0 (even_sum 2), then the maximum is 2.0. So the total latency would be 5.0 (compute4) + 2.0 (max child) = 7.0? But the first synthesis reported latency 5.0. Hmm, that doesn\'t add up. \n\nAlternatively, the compute4\'s latency is the sum of its own latency plus the latencies of the child functions. But compute4\'s option 0 has latency 5.0, which might already include the child functions\' latencies. So when the user selects even_sum 0 (latency 2.0), which is higher than even_sum 2 (1.0), the total latency of compute4 increases. So in the first synthesis, compute4\'s latency was 5.0 (using even_sum 2, which has 1.0 latency). In the second synthesis, using even_sum 0 (latency 2.0), compute4\'s latency increased to 8.0. That suggests that compute4\'s latency is dependent on the child functions\' latencies. So compute4\'s latency is the sum of its own processing plus the maximum child latency, or something similar. \n\nSo the key here is to find a combination of options for each function (odd_factorial, fibonacci, even_sum, compute4) such that the total area is as close as possible to 4000, while minimizing latency. \n\nCurrent observations:\n- odd_factorial and fibonacci have all options with the same area and latency. So changing their options doesn\'t affect the outcome. We can ignore them for now.\n- even_sum has two types of options: 0-1 (lower area, higher latency) and 2-4 (higher area, lower latency).\n- compute4\'s options all have the same area and latency, but when combined with different even_sum options, the total area and latency change.\n\nIn the first synthesis, using even_sum 2 (higher area, lower latency) resulted in total area 8098.5 and latency 5.0.\nIn the second synthesis, using even_sum 0 (lower area, higher latency) resulted in total area 4995.9 and latency 8.0.\n\nThe target area is 4000. Both configurations are over. So we need to reduce the area further.\n\nLooking at the even_sum options, using even_sum 0 gives area 1349.7 each. Since compute4 calls even_sum twice, that\'s 2*1349.7=2699.4. The compute4\'s own area (without children) would then be 4995.9 (total) - 2699.4 (even_sum) - odd_factorial and fibonacci areas. Wait, odd_factorial\'s area is 3696.9, fibonacci is 1640.9. So total area would be compute4\'s area (without children) + odd_factorial + fibonacci + 2*even_sum.\n\nWait, but in the second synthesis, the total area was 4995.9. If compute4\'s area includes its own logic plus the children, then:\n\ncompute4\'s area = 4995.9 (total) = compute4_own_area + odd_factorial_area + fibonacci_area + 2*even_sum_area.\n\nFrom the given options, odd_factorial\'s area is 3696.9, fibonacci is 1640.9, even_sum 0 is 1349.7 each. So:\n\ncompute4_own_area = 4995.9 - 3696.9 - 1640.9 - 2*1349.7 \n= 4995.9 - 3696.9 = 1299.0; 1299.0 -1640.9 = negative. That can\'t be right. So this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: The compute4\'s area in the options (8098.5) includes all child functions. So when you select compute4 0, it uses the default child options (probably even_sum 0, since that\'s the first option). When you override even_sum to 2, the total area becomes higher. But in the first synthesis, using compute4 0 and even_sum 2, the area was 8098.5, which is the same as compute4\'s default. That suggests that overriding the child options doesn\'t change the area, which contradicts the second synthesis where changing even_sum to 0 reduced the area. \n\nThis is confusing. Let\'s try to see the data again. The compute4\'s options all have area 8098.5. But when the user selects compute4 0 and even_sum 0, the total area is 4995.9, which is much lower. How is that possible? Maybe the compute4\'s area in the options is when using the best child options for latency, which might have higher area. When the user selects child options with lower area but higher latency, the total area decreases. So compute4\'s area when using even_sum 0 (lower area) would be compute4\'s own area plus the sum of the child areas. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compute4\'s area is the sum of its own logic plus the sum of the child functions\' areas. So compute4_own_area = compute4_option_area - sum(child_areas). For example, compute4\'s default option (option 0) uses even_sum 0, odd_factorial 0, fibonacci 0. So:\n\nsum(child_areas) = 3696.9 (odd_factorial) + 1640.9 (fibonacci) + 1349.7*2 (even_sum) = 3696.9 + 1640.9 + 2699.4 = 8037.2. \n\nBut compute4\'s area is 8098.5. So compute4_own_area = 8098.5 - 8037.2 = 61.3. That\'s very low. Then, when the user selects even_sum 0 again, the sum of child areas is the same, so total area remains 8098.5. But in the second synthesis, the area was 4995.9, which contradicts this. So this can\'t be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compute4\'s area is separate from the child functions. So the total area is compute4\'s area plus the sum of the child functions\' areas. But compute4\'s area is 8098.5, which is already very high. Adding the child areas would make it way over. But the synthesis reports show lower areas. So this approach isn\'t working.\n\nPerhaps the initial data provided for each function\'s options is incorrect. Or perhaps I\'m misunderstanding how the areas are combined. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe user needs to minimize latency while keeping the area close to 4000. The two synthesis runs so far have areas of 8098.5 and 4995.9, both over 4000. The target is 4000, so we need to reduce area further. \n\nThe even_sum function has options 0 and 1 with area 1349.7, and options 2-4 with 3014.2. Since using even_sum 0 gives lower area, but higher latency, maybe we need to use even_sum 0, but also find other ways to reduce area. However, the other functions (odd_factorial and fibonacci) have fixed areas regardless of their options. So their options can\'t help reduce area. The only way is to adjust even_sum and compute4.\n\nWait, compute4 has options all with area 8098.5. But when the user selected compute4 0 with even_sum 0, the total area was 4995.9. That\'s much lower than 8098.5. So perhaps the compute4\'s area in the options is not the total, but just compute4\'s own area, and the child functions are added separately. So the total area would be compute4\'s area plus the sum of the child functions\' areas. \n\nLet\'s test this. compute4\'s area is 8098.5. Child functions: odd_factorial 0 (3696.9), fibonacci 0 (1640.9), even_sum 0 (1349.7), even_sum 0 (1349.7). Sum these: 8098.5 + 3696.9 + 1640.9 + 1349.7*2 = 8098.5 + 3696.9 = 11795.4 + 1640.9 = 13436.3 + 2699.4 = 16135.7. But the synthesis result was 4995.9, which is way lower. So this can\'t be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compute4\'s area includes the child functions. So the compute4\'s area of 8098.5 includes all the child functions. But when you select different options for the child functions, you replace their areas. For example, compute4\'s default option 0 uses even_sum 0 (1349.7 each), so two even_sum 0s contribute 2699.4. If you replace them with even_sum 2 (3014.2 each), that\'s an increase of (3014.2 -1349.7)*2 = 3329. So compute4\'s total area would be 8098.5 + 3329 = 11427.5. But in the first synthesis, the area was 8098.5. So this doesn\'t fit. \n\nThis is really confusing. Let me try to look at the synthesis reports again. \n\nFirst synthesis: compute4 0, even_sum 2. Total area 8098.5. Latency 5.0.\nSecond synthesis: compute4 0, even_sum 0. Total area 4995.9. Latency 8.0.\n\nThe only difference is even_sum 2 vs 0. So the area difference is 8098.5 -4995.9 = 3102.6. The even_sum options have a difference of 3014.2 -1349.7 = 1664.5 per instance. Two instances would be 3329. The area difference in the reports is 3102.6, which is close. So maybe the total area is compute4\'s area (which includes its own logic plus the child functions) minus the difference caused by changing even_sum options. \n\nSo when using even_sum 0, the total area is compute4\'s area (with default even_sum 0) minus the difference when changing to even_sum 2. But I\'m not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compute4\'s area in the options is when using even_sum 0, and when you change to even_sum 2, you add the difference. For example, compute4\'s default area is 8098.5 with even_sum 0. If you switch to even_sum 2 (which is 3014.2 -1349.7 = 1664.5 more per instance), two instances would add 3329, making total area 8098.5 + 3329 = 11427.5. But the first synthesis report says the area was 8098.5. That doesn\'t match.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Let\'s try a different approach. The user needs to minimize latency and get area close to 4000. The current best area is 4995.9 (still over 4000). To reduce area further, maybe we need to use even_sum options with lower area. But even_sum 0 and 1 are already the lowest. However, compute4\'s area is still high. Maybe the compute4\'s options can be adjusted, but all its options have the same area. So the only way is to find if there\'s a compute4 option that uses fewer resources. But according to the data, all compute4 options have the same area. \n\nWait, but the user hasn\'t tried other compute4 options. The user tried compute4 0 both times. Maybe other compute4 options have different areas when combined with different child options. But according to the initial data, all compute4 options have the same area. So maybe the compute4\'s options are different in terms of their own pipelining or unrolling, but when combined with child options, the total area changes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compute4\'s options affect how the child functions are called. For example, compute4 option 0 might call the child functions sequentially, while option 1 might unroll them. But since all compute4 options have the same area and latency in the initial data, that\'s unclear.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to try to find a combination that uses even_sum 0 (lowest area) and see if there are other functions that can be adjusted. But odd_factorial and fibonacci have fixed areas. So the only variables are even_sum and compute4. Since compute4\'s options don\'t affect area (all are 8098.5), but when combined with even_sum 0, the total area was 4995.9. To get closer to 4000, maybe we need to find other functions to optimize. But the other functions (odd_factorial, fibonacci) don\'t have options that affect area. \n\nWait, looking back, the options for odd_factorial are all the same. So changing their options doesn\'t help. Same with fibonacci. The only variable is even_sum and compute4. But compute4\'s area is fixed. So perhaps the user needs to find a way to reduce the impact of compute4\'s area. But compute4\'s area is 8098.5 in the options, which is way over 4000. But in the second synthesis, when using compute4 0 and even_sum 0, the total area was 4995.9. That suggests that compute4\'s area in the options includes the child functions, and by selecting even_sum 0, the total area is lower. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compute4\'s area in the options is its own area, and the child functions are added to it. So if compute4\'s area is 8098.5, and the child functions are 3696.9 (odd_factorial) + 1640.9 (fibonacci) + 2*1349.7 (even_sum) = 3696.9 + 1640.9 = 5337.8 + 2699.4 = 8037.2. Total area would be 8098.5 + 8037.2 = 16135.7, which is way higher than the synthesis results. So that\'s impossible. \n\nThis suggests that the initial understanding of how areas are calculated is incorrect. Maybe the area values provided for each function are not additive. Instead, when a parent function is synthesized with child functions, the area is the total of the parent\'s logic plus the child functions\' areas. But the options for the parent function\'s area already include the child functions\' areas. So if compute4\'s option 0 has area 8098.5, that\'s the total area when synthesized with the child functions. But when the user selects different child options, the total area is adjusted based on the difference between the default child options and the selected ones. \n\nFor example, compute4\'s default option uses even_sum 0 (area 1349.7 each). If the user selects even_sum 2 (3014.2 each), the difference per instance is 3014.2 -1349.7 = 1664.5. Two instances would add 3329.0 to the total area. So compute4\'s area becomes 8098.5 + 3329.0 = 11427.5. But the first synthesis reported an area of 8098.5. That doesn\'t match. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compute4\'s area in the options is without the child functions, and the child functions\' areas are added. But then compute4\'s area would be much lower. For example, in the second synthesis, the total area was 4995.9. If that\'s compute4\'s own area plus child areas: compute4_own_area + 3696.9 + 1640.9 + 2*1349.7 = compute4_own_area + 8037.2 = 4995.9. So compute4_own_area = 4995.9 -8037.2 = negative. Impossible. \n\nThis is really confusing. Given the time I\'ve spent and the lack of clarity, perhaps the best approach is to try to find a configuration that uses even_sum 0 (lowest area) and see if there\'s a way to reduce compute4\'s area. But since compute4\'s options all have the same area, that\'s not possible. \n\nWait, the problem statement says that different options use different unrolling and pipelining factors. So perhaps the compute4\'s options affect how it\'s synthesized, which might influence the area. But according to the initial data, all compute4 options have the same area and latency. So that\'s not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compute4\'s options affect the way it calls the child functions, like parallel vs sequential. For example, option 0 might call the child functions sequentially, leading to higher latency, while option 1 might pipeline them, reducing latency. But the initial data says all compute4 options have latency 5.0. \n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the next step is to run a Python script using OR-Tools to model the problem and find the optimal combination. The script would need to minimize latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 4000. \n\nThe variables are the options for each function: odd_factorial (0-4), fibonacci (0-4), even_sum (0-4), compute4 (0-4). The area for each function\'s option is known, and the latency is also known. The total area is the sum of the areas of all functions\' selected options. Wait, no. Because compute4 includes the child functions, so if we select compute4\'s option, does it include the child functions\' areas? Or do we have to sum all selected options\' areas?\n\nBut according to the initial data, when compute4 is synthesized, it includes the child functions. So the total area when selecting compute4\'s option is the area of compute4\'s option, which already includes the child functions\' areas. But when the user selects specific child options, that overrides the ones used in compute4\'s synthesis, leading to a different total area. \n\nThis is the crux of the problem. Without knowing how the areas are combined, it\'s hard to model. But given the synthesis results, it\'s clear that changing even_sum\'s options affects the total area. \n\nAssuming that the total area is compute4\'s area (from its option) plus the sum of the child functions\' selected options\' areas. But compute4\'s area in the options is when using the default child options. So if you select different child options, the total area is compute4\'s default area minus the default child areas plus the selected child areas. \n\nFor example, compute4\'s option 0 has area 8098.5, which includes odd_factorial 0, fibonacci 0, even_sum 0, even_sum 0. The areas of these are 3696.9, 1640.9, 1349.7, 1349.7. Total child areas: 3696.9 +1640.9 +1349.7*2 = 8037.2. So compute4\'s own area (without children) would be 8098.5 -8037.2 = 61.3 (unlikely). \n\nIf the user selects even_sum 2, which has area 3014.2, then the new total area would be compute4\'s own area (61.3) + 3696.9 +1640.9 +3014.2*2 = 61.3 +3696.9= 3758.2 +1640.9= 5399.1 +6028.4= 11427.5. But the synthesis result was 8098.5, which doesn\'t match. \n\nThis approach isn\'t working. Given the time I\'ve spent, maybe I should proceed to use OR-Tools to model the problem, assuming that the total area is the sum of the selected options\' areas for each function. But given that compute4\'s options include child functions, that might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total area is just the area of the top function, which is compute4, since it includes all children. But in the second synthesis, using compute4 0 and even_sum 0, the area was 4995.9, which is lower than compute4\'s option 0 area of 8098.5. So that can\'t be. \n\nGiven the confusion, maybe the best approach is to try different even_sum options and see if that helps. But since even_sum 0 gives the lowest area, and we need to get closer to 4000, perhaps we need to find other functions to optimize. But the other functions\' options don\'t affect area. \n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: "The goal is to minimize the latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to a target value of 4000." The current best area is 4995.9, which is 995.9 over the target. To reduce further, maybe we need to find a way to reduce the area of compute4. But all compute4 options have the same area. Unless there\'s a misunderstanding. \n\nWait, in the initial data, compute4 has five options, all with area 8098.5. But in the synthesis reports, when using compute4 0 with even_sum 0, the total area was 4995.9. This suggests that compute4\'s area in the options is not the total area, but part of it. Perhaps the total area is the sum of compute4\'s option area plus the sum of the child functions\' selected options. But compute4\'s area is 8098.5, and the child areas are added. But that would make the total area way higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compute4\'s area is the maximum of its own area and the child areas. But that doesn\'t make sense. \n\nAnother possibility: The area values provided for each function are for the function itself, not including children. So when you synthesize compute4, its area is compute4\'s own area plus the sum of the child functions\' areas. So total area = compute4_area + odd_factorial_area + fibonacci_area + even_sum_area *2. \n\nIf that\'s the case, then the total area can be computed as:\n\ncompute4\'s selected option\'s area + odd_factorial\'s selected option\'s area + fibonacci\'s selected option\'s area + even_sum\'s selected option\'s area *2.\n\nGiven that, and since compute4\'s options all have area 8098.5, which is very high, the total area would be way over 4000. But in the second synthesis, the total area was 4995.9. So this approach can\'t be correct. \n\nAlternatively, the compute4\'s area is not part of the total, and the total is just the sum of the child functions. But compute4\'s children are odd_factorial, fibonacci, even_sum, even_sum. So their areas would be 3696.9 +1640.9 +1349.7*2 = 8037.2. But the synthesis report was 4995.9. Again, not matching. \n\nI\'m stuck. Perhaps I should proceed with the information I have. The user needs to get the total area as close as possible to 4000. The current best is 4995.9. To reduce further, maybe use even_sum 0 and see if there\'s a way to reduce compute4\'s area. But compute4\'s options are fixed. \n\nWait, maybe the user hasn\'t tried other compute4 options. All compute4 options have the same area, but perhaps different latencies when combined with different child options. But according to the initial data, all compute4 options have latency 5.0. But in the second synthesis, the latency was 8.0. So perhaps the latency depends on the child functions. \n\nThe latency of compute4 is the sum of its own latency plus the latencies of the child functions. For example, compute4\'s latency is 5.0, and if the child functions have higher latency, the total increases. \n\nIn the first synthesis, child latencies were odd_factorial 2.0, fibonacci 2.0, even_sum 1.0, even_sum 1.0. The maximum child latency is 2.0. So compute4\'s latency could be 5.0 + 2.0 =7.0. But the synthesis reported 5.0. Doesn\'t add up. \n\nAlternatively, the compute4\'s latency is the sum of the child latencies plus its own. For example, odd_factorial (2) + fibonacci (2) + even_sum (1) + even_sum (1) + compute4\'s own latency (5) = 11. But the first synthesis reported latency 5.0. \n\nThis is not making sense. Given the time I\'ve spent, I think the best approach is to use the Python option with OR-Tools to model the problem. The script should find the combination of function options that minimizes latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 4000. \n\nAssuming that the total area is the sum of the areas of all selected function options (including compute4 and its children), even though the synthesis results don\'t align with this, perhaps the model can be adjusted. \n\nThe functions to consider are odd_factorial, fibonacci, even_sum (two instances), and compute4. But compute4\'s area is fixed. However, the synthesis reports show that changing even_sum options affects the total area, which suggests that the total area is compute4\'s area plus the sum of the child functions\' areas. \n\nBut according to the initial data, compute4\'s area is 8098.5. Adding the child areas would make it way over. But the second synthesis\'s area was 4995.9. So this approach is invalid. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the user should inspect other function options to gather more data. For example, inspect compute4\'s other options to see if they have different areas when combined with certain child options. But according to the initial data, all compute4 options have the same area and latency. \n\nAlternatively, the user should run a profile to see which functions are taking the most time, but since this is HLS, the profile might not be applicable. \n\nAnother idea: The target area is 4000, and the current best is 4995.9. To get closer, perhaps the even_sum options need to be set to 0, which gives the lowest area. Then, see if other functions can be optimized. But odd_factorial and fibonacci can\'t be optimized further. So the only option is to reduce compute4\'s area, but all its options are the same. \n\nThis suggests that it\'s impossible to reach the target area of 4000 with the given options. The closest possible is 4995.9. But maybe there\'s a combination where even_sum is used once and another function is omitted, but according to the call graph, compute4 calls even_sum twice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compute4\'s area can be reduced by selecting a different option. But all compute4 options have the same area. \n\nGiven all this, the conclusion is that the minimal achievable area is 4995.9, which is the lowest from the second synthesis. But the user needs to get as close as possible to 4000. Since this isn\'t possible with the current options, perhaps the solution is to accept the configuration with the lowest area, which is the second one: odd_factorial 0, fibonacci 0, even_sum 0, compute4 0. \n\nBut the user\'s goal is to minimize latency while keeping the area close to 4000. The second configuration has higher latency (8.0) but lower area (4995.9). The first configuration has lower latency (5.0) but higher area (8098.5). \n\nTo find a balance, perhaps there\'s a combination that uses even_sum 1 (same as 0) but with different compute4 options. But all compute4 options are the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using even_sum 1 (same area as 0) and compute4 0 gives the same result. \n\nGiven that, the user might have to accept that the target area is unattainable and choose the configuration with the lowest area, even though it\'s over. \n\nBut the user instructed to keep the area as close as possible to 4000. So the second synthesis (4995.9) is closer than the first (8098.5). But maybe there\'s another configuration with even lower area. \n\nWait, the odd_factorial and fibonacci functions have options with area 3696.9 and 1640.9 respectively. These are fixed. So their total is 3696.9 +1640.9 = 5337.8. Adding even_sum 0 twice (1349.7*2=2699.4) gives 5337.8 +2699.4=8037.2. Adding compute4\'s area (8098.5) gives 16135.7, which is way over. But the synthesis result was 4995.9. This suggests that the compute4\'s area is not additive with the child functions. \n\nAt this point, I think the best action is to run a Python script using OR-Tools to model the problem, even if the area calculation is unclear. The script can try to minimize latency while keeping the area as close as possible to 4000. \n\nThe script would need to consider all possible combinations of options for each function, calculate the total area and latency, and find the combination with the minimum latency where the area is closest to 4000. \n\nHowever, without knowing how the areas combine, this is challenging. For the sake of proceeding, I\'ll assume that the total area is the sum of the areas of all functions\' selected options. \n\nGiven that, the functions are: odd_factorial (5 options, all area 3696.9), fibonacci (5 options, all area 1640.9), even_sum (5 options: 0-1 area 1349.7, 2-4 area 3014.2), compute4 (5 options, all area 8098.5). \n\nBut this would make the total area at least 3696.9 +1640.9 +1349.7*2 +8098.5 = 16135.7, which is way over. But the synthesis reports show lower areas, so this approach is wrong. \n\nGiven the time I\'ve spent and the lack of clarity, I\'ll suggest accepting the second configuration as the best possible, even though it\'s over the target area. Alternatively, the user might need to run more synthesis steps with different even_sum options. \n\nBut the user has tried even_sum 0 and 2. Maybe trying even_sum 1 would give the same area as 0. Since options 0 and 1 for even_sum have the same area and latency. \n\nSo the next step could be to synthesize with even_sum 1 to see if the area remains the same. \n\nAlternatively, since even_sum 0 and 1 are the same, the user can proceed to accept the solution with even_sum 0. \n\nBut the goal is to minimize latency. The first configuration had latency 5.0, area 8098.5. Second configuration: latency 8.0, area 4995.9. To find a balance, perhaps a configuration with even_sum 0 and compute4 options that have lower latency. But all compute4 options have latency 5.0. \n\nSo, the best latency is 5.0 with area 8098.5, or 8.0 with area 4995.9. The user needs to choose which is closer to the target area. 4995.9 is closer to 4000 than 8098.5. But perhaps there\'s a configuration with intermediate even_sum options. \n\nWait, even_sum has options 0-1 (area 1349.7, latency 2.0), and 2-4 (area 3014.2, latency 1.0). If the user uses one even_sum 0 and one even_sum 2, would that be possible? But according to the call graph, compute4 calls even_sum twice. So both instances must use the same option. Or can they use different options? \n\nThe problem statement says: "Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function." This implies that each instance can have a different option. But the user\'s previous commands specified even_sum 0 or 2, which applies to both instances. So maybe the user needs to specify two different options for even_sum. But the way the options are structured isn\'t clear. \n\nAssuming that each call to even_sum can have a different option, but the user can only specify one option for the function, which applies to all instances. For example, if compute4 calls even_sum twice, both instances use the same option selected by the user. \n\nThus, to have a mixed configuration, the user can\'t. Therefore, the even_sum option applies to both calls. \n\nGiven that, the only way to reduce area further is to use even_sum 0 or 1. Which gives the same area. \n\nThus, the minimal area achievable is 4995.9, and the minimal latency is 5.0 (with area 8098.5). Since the user needs to keep area as close to 4000 as possible, the second configuration is better. \n\nTherefore, the solution is to accept the second configuration: odd_factorial 0, fibonacci 0, even_sum 0, compute4 0. \n\nBut before accepting, perhaps the user should run a Python script to confirm. \n\nThe Python script using OR-Tools can model this as an optimization problem where the objective is to minimize latency, subject to the area being as close as possible to 4000. \n\nThe script would need to consider all possible combinations of options for each function, calculate the total area and latency, and find the best combination. \n\nHowever, given the confusion about how areas are calculated, the script might not be accurate. But proceeding under the assumption that the total area is compute4\'s area plus the sum of the child areas (even though this doesn\'t align with synthesis results), the script can be written as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom ortools.sat.python import cp_model\n\n# Function options data\nfunctions = {\n    \'odd_factorial\': [\n        {\'area\': 3696.9, \'latency\': 2.0},\n        {\'area\': 3696.9, \'latency\': 2.0},\n        {\'area\': 3696.9, \'latency\': 2.0},\n        {\'area\': 3696.9, \'latency\': 2.0},\n        {\'area\': 3696.9, \'latency\': 2.0},\n    ],\n    \'fibonacci\': [\n        {\'area\': 1640.9, \'latency\': 2.0},\n        {\'area\': 1640.9, \'latency\': 2.0},\n        {\'area\': 1640.9, \'latency\': 2.0},\n        {\'area\': 1640.9, \'latency\': 2.0},\n        {\'area\': 1640.9, \'latency\': 2.0},\n    ],\n    \'even_sum\': [\n        {\'area\': 1349.7, \'latency\': 2.0},\n        {\'area\': 1349.7, \'latency\': 2.0},\n        {\'area\': 3014.2, \'latency\': 1.0},\n        {\'area\': 3014.2, \'latency\': 1.0},\n        {\'area\': 3014.2, \'latency\': 1.0},\n    ],\n    \'compute4\': [\n        {\'area\': 8098.5, \'latency\': 5.0},\n        {\'area\': 8098.5, \'latency\': 5.0},\n        {\'area\': 8098.5, \'latency\': 5.0},\n        {\'area\': 8098.5, \'latency\': 5.0},\n        {\'area\': 8098.5, \'latency\': 5.0},\n    ],\n}\n\n# Target area\ntarget_area = 4000\n\n# Create model\nmodel = cp_model.CpModel()\n\n# Variables\noptions = {}\nfor func in functions:\n    options[func] = model.NewIntVar(0, len(functions[func]) - 1, func)\n\n# Area and latency expressions\narea = 0\nlatency = 0\nfor func in functions:\n    # Create a variable for each option\'s contribution\n    func_area = model.NewIntVar(0, int(1e6), f\'{func}_area\')\n    func_latency = model.NewIntVar(0, int(1e6), f\'{func}_latency\')\n    \n    # Add element constraint to link option choice to area and latency\n    areas = [int(round(f[\'area\'] * 10)) for f in functions[func]]\n    latencies = [int(round(f[\'latency\'] * 10)) for f in functions[func]]\n    \n    model.AddElement(options[func], areas, func_area)\n    model.AddElement(options[func], latencies, func_latency)\n    \n    area += func_area\n    latency += func_latency\n\n# Adjust for compute4\'s children: compute4 includes odd_factorial, fibonacci, and two even_sums\n# But this is unclear, so the model might need adjustment\n# Assuming compute4\'s area is standalone, and children are added separately:\n# area = compute4_area + odd_factorial_area + fibonacci_area + 2*even_sum_area\n# latency = compute4_latency + max(odd_fact_latency, fib_latency, even_sum_latency)\n# But this requires a more complex model.\n\n# Since the model is complex and area calculation is unclear, this approach might not work.\n\n# Instead, assuming the total area is compute4\'s area plus children\'s areas (from the selected options)\n# But compute4\'s area is fixed at 8098.5, children\'s areas are as selected.\n\n# However, based on the synthesis reports, this is not the case.\n\n# Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to suggest accepting the second configuration.'))], created=1740857046, model='deepseek-reasoner', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_5417b77867_prod0225', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=10915, prompt_tokens=1498, total_tokens=12413, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 1280}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 10892}, prompt_cache_hit_tokens=1280, prompt_cache_miss_tokens=218))
