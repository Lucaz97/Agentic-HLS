This is the call graph for the application at hand:
{'sha256_transform': [], 'sha256_init': [], 'sha256_update': ['sha256_transform'], 'sha256_final': ['sha256_transform', 'memset', 'sha256_transform'], 'main': ['sha256_init', 'sha256_update', 'sha256_final', 'printf']}

The application has the following functions with their respective options:
Option for sha256_transform_hls -  area: 34078.8, latency: 80.0, throughput: 83.0
Option for sha256_transform_hls -  area: 34078.8, latency: 80.0, throughput: 83.0

Option for sha256_update_hls -  area: 41862.5, latency: 84.0, throughput: 86.0


The synthesizable function names have an extras posfix _hls. Use this name to refer to the function in the optimization process indexing the options starting from 0.
The throughput is expressed in period, the lower the better.

The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions.
This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function.
Different options use different unrolling and pipelining factors. 

The goal is to minimize the latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 40000.

Provide your first request:

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91adb2c91d835e6e', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, let\'s start by understanding the problem. The goal is to optimize the HLS configuration for the given application to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 40,000. The functions involved are sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls, each with multiple options.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the available options. For sha256_transform_hls, all five options have the same area, latency, and throughput. That\'s odd. Maybe they\'re different in some way not captured here, but the user provided them as separate options. Since they\'re identical, choosing any of them won\'t affect the area or latency. So the focus shifts to sha256_update_hls, which has five different options.\n\nLooking at sha256_update_hls options:\n\nOption 0: area 50440.8, latency 83\nOption 1: area 44444.2, latency 81\nOption 2: area 41479.4, latency 84\nOption 3: area 42204.3, latency 84\nOption 4: area 41862.5, latency 84\n\nThe target area is 40,000. So options 2, 3, 4 are closer in area (around 41k-42k), while option 1 is 44k and option 0 is 50k. Since we want to stay close to 40k, options 2,3,4 are better. However, their latencies are 84, which is higher than option 1\'s 81. But option 1\'s area is 44k, which is over the target. So there\'s a trade-off here.\n\nThe main function calls sha256_update, which in turn calls sha256_transform. Since sha256_transform\'s options are all the same, their impact is fixed. The total area would be the sum of the areas of sha256_update_hls and sha256_transform_hls. Wait, but when synthesizing a parent function, the child functions are included. So if sha256_update_hls is synthesized with a certain option, does that include the area of sha256_transform_hls? The problem statement says: "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So the area reported for sha256_update_hls already includes the area of sha256_transform_hls (since it\'s a child). Similarly, sha256_final calls sha256_transform and others, but its options aren\'t provided here. Wait, the user listed the functions with their options, but only sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls have options. The others (sha256_init, sha256_final, main) aren\'t listed, so maybe they don\'t have configurable options. So the only functions we can configure are sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls.\n\nWait, the problem says "The application has the following functions with their respective options:" and lists sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. So those are the only two functions with options. The other functions (like sha256_init, sha256_final, main) don\'t have options, so their area and latency are fixed, or perhaps their options are not part of the optimization. So the total area would be the sum of the areas of sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls, since they are the only configurable parts. Wait, but when synthesizing sha256_update_hls, it includes the sha256_transform_hls. So the area of sha256_update_hls already includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Because when you synthesize a parent function, the child functions are part of it. So the total area would just be the area of sha256_update_hls, since it includes the transform. Wait, but the call graph shows that sha256_final also calls sha256_transform. So if sha256_final is part of the application, but it\'s not configurable, then the total area would include sha256_update_hls (which includes sha256_transform) and sha256_final\'s area. But the problem statement says that the area reported for a function includes the child functions. So if sha256_update_hls is synthesized with a certain option, its area includes the sha256_transform_hls. Similarly, sha256_final would include its own area plus any child functions. But since sha256_final\'s options aren\'t provided, perhaps its area is fixed. So the total area would be the sum of the areas of sha256_update_hls and sha256_final, but since we can\'t configure sha256_final, maybe the only variable is sha256_update_hls and sha256_transform_hls. Wait, but the problem says that the options for sha256_transform_hls are all the same. So regardless of which option we choose for sha256_transform_hls, the area and latency are the same. So the only variable is sha256_update_hls. Because even if we select different options for sha256_transform_hls, they all have the same area and latency. So the choice for sha256_transform_hls doesn\'t matter. Therefore, the total area is determined by the sha256_update_hls option chosen, since it includes the sha256_transform_hls area. Wait, but the area of sha256_update_hls\'s options already includes the sha256_transform_hls\'s area. For example, option 0 of sha256_update_hls has area 50440.8, which includes the sha256_transform_hls\'s area of 34078.8. So the total area of the application would be the sum of the areas of all the functions, but since some functions include others, we need to be careful. However, according to the problem statement, when a function is synthesized in isolation, the area includes the child functions. So if we choose an option for sha256_update_hls, its area includes the sha256_transform_hls. But then, what about other functions like sha256_final, which also calls sha256_transform? If sha256_final is synthesized, does it include another instance of sha256_transform_hls? That would lead to duplication. But in HLS, if multiple functions call the same child function, the tool might instantiate it multiple times, increasing the area. However, the problem statement says that the values reported for a function (like sha256_update_hls) include the child functions. So if sha256_update_hls is synthesized, its area includes the sha256_transform_hls. Similarly, sha256_final, when synthesized, would include its own instance of sha256_transform_hls. But since we can\'t configure sha256_final, perhaps its area is fixed, and the total area would be the sum of the areas of sha256_update_hls (including transform) and sha256_final (including transform again). That would mean the total area is higher than the individual areas. But the problem statement says that the goal is to keep the total area as close as possible to 40,000. However, looking at the options for sha256_update_hls, even the smallest area (option 2: 41479.4) is already over 40k. So maybe there\'s a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the area reported for sha256_update_hls is only for that function, and the child functions are considered separately. But the problem statement says that when synthesizing a function in isolation, the area includes the child functions. So if we select sha256_update_hls option 2, its area is 41479.4, which includes the sha256_transform_hls\'s area. Then, if sha256_final also calls sha256_transform, which is part of the same module, perhaps the tool would reuse the same instance, but in HLS, each call might lead to separate instances unless they are inlined or shared. This could complicate the total area calculation. However, given the problem statement\'s information, perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of all the synthesized functions. But since the user hasn\'t provided options for sha256_final, maybe its area is fixed, and the only variables are sha256_update_hls and sha256_transform_hls. But the options for sha256_transform_hls are all the same, so the only variable is sha256_update_hls. Therefore, the total area would be the area of sha256_update_hls (which includes sha256_transform) plus the area of sha256_final (which includes another sha256_transform). But since we can\'t configure sha256_final, perhaps its area is fixed, leading to a higher total area. However, the problem statement\'s target is 40,000, and the smallest sha256_update_hls area is 41k, which is already over. This suggests that perhaps the target is for the sum of the configurable functions\' areas. But given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the given options and see.\n\nThe user\'s first step is to decide which action to take. The options are to synthesize, inspect, run a Python script, profile, or accept a solution. Since this is the first step, the agent might want to gather more information. However, the agent could also try to make an initial synthesis to get data points.\n\nAlternatively, since the options for sha256_transform_hls are all the same, choosing any of them (e.g., option 0) won\'t affect the area or latency. So the main decision is which option to choose for sha256_update_hls. The goal is to minimize latency while keeping area close to 40k. The sha256_update_hls options with the lowest latency are option 1 (latency 81, area 44k) and options 0 (latency 83, area 50k). But 44k is over the target. The options with area closer to 40k are options 2,3,4 (41k-42k), but their latency is 84. So there\'s a trade-off between latency and area.\n\nThe agent might want to synthesize a configuration that uses sha256_update_hls option 2 (area 41479.4, latency 84) and sha256_transform_hls option 0 (since all are same). Then see the total area and latency. But according to the problem statement, the area of sha256_update_hls already includes the transform\'s area. So the total area would be 41479.4 (for update) plus any other fixed areas (like sha256_final, which might include another transform). But since the user hasn\'t provided data on other functions, perhaps the target is just for the configurable functions. If the target is 40k, then 41k is close. So maybe the agent should try option 2 for sha256_update_hls and any option for transform (since they are same). Then see the total area and latency.\n\nAlternatively, the agent might want to run a Python script to model this as an optimization problem. For example, using OR-Tools to find the combination that minimizes latency subject to the area being as close as possible to 40k. But given that there are only two functions (transform and update), and transform\'s options are all the same, the only variable is the update\'s option. So the problem reduces to choosing the update option that has the lowest latency with area closest to 40k.\n\nThe possible options for update are:\n\nOption 1: area 44444.2, latency 81\nOption 2: area 41479.4, latency 84\nOption 3: 42204.3, 84\nOption 4: 41862.5, 84\n\nThe target area is 40k. The closest areas are options 2 (41479.4), 4 (41862.5), and 3 (42204.3). Among these, option 2 has the lowest area (41,479.4) but higher latency (84). Option 1 has lower latency (81) but higher area (44,444.2). The agent needs to balance between latency and area.\n\nIf the priority is to minimize latency, then option 1 is better, but area is 44k. If the priority is to meet the area target, then options 2,4 are better. The problem states to minimize latency while keeping area as close as possible to 40k. So perhaps the agent should try to find the option with the lowest latency where the area is closest to 40k. Among the options, option 2 has area 41,479.4 (1,479.4 over), option 4 is 41,862.5 (1,862.5 over), and option 3 is 42,204.3 (2,204.3 over). So option 2 is closest. However, its latency is 84, which is higher than option 1\'s 81. So there\'s a trade-off.\n\nThe agent might need to synthesize a few configurations to see the actual total area and latency. For example, synthesizing option 2 for update and any transform option. Then see if the total area is 41,479.4 (assuming that\'s the only configurable part) and latency 84. If that\'s acceptable, then proceed. Alternatively, if the total area includes other functions, maybe the target is not achievable, and the agent has to choose the closest.\n\nBut given the initial information, the agent\'s first step could be to synthesize the configuration with sha256_update_hls option 2 and sha256_transform_hls option 0 (since all are same). The command would be:\n\nsynthesis: sha256_transform_hls 0, sha256_update_hls 2\n\nAlternatively, since the transform options are all the same, maybe the agent can just choose any, but the user requires specifying all functions. So the first step is to synthesize this configuration to get the actual area and latency. Then, based on the result, decide next steps.\n</think>\n\nsynthesis: sha256_transform_hls 0, sha256_update_hls 2', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=11679713830483427000)], created=1741052770, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2933, prompt_tokens=927, total_tokens=3860), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91adb5817e777cf6', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, let\'s see. The user is trying to optimize a C application using HLS. The goal is to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 40,000. The last synthesis attempt used sha256_transform_hls option 0 and sha256_update_hls option 2. The result was a total area of 41,479.4, which is a bit over the target of 40,000. The latency for sha256_update_hls was 84.\n\nLooking at the options for sha256_update_hls, option 1 has an area of 44,444.2 and latency 81. That\'s a lower latency but higher area. Option 2, which was used, has a lower area (41,479.4) but higher latency (84). The target area is 40k, so maybe we can find a configuration that brings the area closer without increasing latency too much.\n\nWait, the sha256_transform_hls options all have the same area and latency. So changing its option won\'t affect anything. All five options are identical. That\'s strange, maybe a mistake in the data? But assuming that\'s correct, the only variable here is the sha256_update_hls options.\n\nThe current total area after synthesis was 41,479.4. The target is 40k, so we need to reduce by about 1,479. Let\'s check other options for sha256_update_hls. Option 3 has area 42,204.3, which is higher than option 2. Option 4 is 41,862.5, still higher than option 2. Option 0 is 50,440.8, way too high. So option 2 is the lowest area for sha256_update_hls. But even that gives a total area over 40k. Hmm.\n\nWait, the total area reported in the synthesis result is 41,479.4. That\'s the Post-Assignment area. The target is 40k, so maybe we need to find a way to reduce further. But the options for sha256_update_hls don\'t have a lower area than option 2. Unless there\'s a combination with other functions. But looking at the call graph, sha256_final depends on sha256_transform and memset. But the options provided are only for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. The other functions like sha256_init, sha256_final, main don\'t have options listed. So maybe the only tunable functions are sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls.\n\nSince sha256_transform_hls options are all the same, changing them doesn\'t affect area or latency. So the only variable is sha256_update_hls. The current best area is option 2 (41,479.4), which is the lowest. But it\'s still over 40k. The next option is to see if combining with a different option of sha256_update_hls that has lower area, but the options don\'t go lower than 41k. So maybe the target area is not achievable with the given options. But the user wants to get as close as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total area is the sum of all functions. Wait, the problem says "total area as close as possible to a target value". The functions being synthesized are sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. The other functions (like sha256_init, sha256_final, main) might not be synthesized, or their area is fixed. So the total area would be the sum of the areas of the synthesized functions. But in the last synthesis, sha256_transform_hls option 0 has area 34,078.8 and sha256_update_hls option 2 has area 41,479.4. Wait, but the total area reported was 41,479.4. That suggests that maybe the sha256_transform_hls is included within the sha256_update_hls synthesis, so its area is already accounted for in the sha256_update_hls\'s area. Because sha256_update calls sha256_transform, so when synthesizing sha256_update_hls, it includes the child function\'s area. So the total area for the design is just the area of the top function synthesized, which in this case is sha256_update_hls. Because the main function calls sha256_update, which is synthesized, and the others (sha256_init, sha256_final) might not be synthesized. Or perhaps the total area is the sum of all synthesized functions. But the problem statement says that when synthesizing a function, the child functions are included. So if sha256_update_hls is synthesized with option 2, its area includes the sha256_transform_hls\'s area. But in the given options, sha256_transform_hls\'s area is 34k, and sha256_update_hls\'s options have areas around 41k to 50k. So maybe the area of sha256_update_hls includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, the total area is just the area of the top-level function being synthesized, which in this case is sha256_update_hls. Because when you synthesize sha256_update_hls, it includes the sha256_transform_hls inside it. So the total area is the area reported for sha256_update_hls, which in the last synthesis was 41,479.4. The target is 40k, so we need to get closer. But the options for sha256_update_hls don\'t have a lower area than option 2. So maybe the closest we can get is 41k. But perhaps there\'s a way to combine different options. Wait, but the user can only choose options for each function. Since sha256_transform_hls\'s options all have the same area and latency, changing them doesn\'t help. So the only variable is sha256_update_hls. The options for sha256_update_hls with lower area are option 2 (41,479.4), option 4 (41,862.5), option 3 (42,204.3), etc. So option 2 is the lowest. But it\'s still over 40k. Maybe the user needs to accept that the closest possible is 41k. But the problem says to keep the total area as close as possible to 40k. So maybe the next step is to try other options of sha256_update_hls that have lower area, but there are none. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options for sha256_update_hls are:\n\n0: area 50440.8, latency 83\n\n1: area 44444.2, latency 81\n\n2: area 41479.4, latency 84\n\n3: area 42204.3, latency 84\n\n4: area 41862.5, latency 84\n\nSo option 2 has the lowest area (41,479.4) but latency 84. Option 1 has higher area (44k) but lower latency (81). So if the user wants to minimize latency, maybe option 1 is better, but the area is higher. The target area is 40k, so 41k is closer than 44k. So perhaps the best configuration is sha256_update_hls option 2, giving area 41k and latency 84. But maybe there\'s a way to combine with other functions. Wait, the main function calls sha256_init, sha256_update, sha256_final. But the only functions with options are sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. Sha256_final calls sha256_transform, so if sha256_final is synthesized, but the user hasn\'t provided options for it. So perhaps the only functions we can optimize are sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. But sha256_transform_hls\'s options are all the same, so they don\'t affect the result. Therefore, the only variable is sha256_update_hls\'s option. The best area is option 2, but it\'s over 40k. The next step could be to try other options to see if their actual synthesized area is lower. Wait, the user provided the options\' area, but when synthesized, the actual area might differ. For example, in the last synthesis, sha256_update_hls option 2 was supposed to have area 41479.4, and the synthesis result was 41479.4. So that\'s accurate. Therefore, there\'s no better option in terms of area. So the closest we can get is 41,479.4. But the target is 40k. Maybe the user needs to accept this as the closest possible. Alternatively, maybe combining with a different option of sha256_transform_hls, but all its options are the same. So no help there. Therefore, the conclusion is that the best configuration is sha256_update_hls option 2, giving area ~41.5k and latency 84. But the user wants to minimize latency. If we choose sha256_update_hls option 1, which has latency 81 but area 44k, that\'s further from the target area. So the trade-off is between latency and area. Since the goal is to minimize latency while keeping area as close as possible to 40k, option 2 is better because it\'s closer in area, even though the latency is higher. So the solution would be to accept sha256_update_hls option 2. But maybe there\'s another approach. Let me think again. The problem says that the child functions are included in the parent\'s synthesis. So when synthesizing sha256_update_hls, it includes sha256_transform_hls. But all options for sha256_transform_hls are the same, so changing them doesn\'t affect the parent\'s synthesis. Therefore, the only choice is sha256_update_hls\'s options. So the best possible configuration is sha256_update_hls option 2. Therefore, the next step is to accept this as the solution. But the user might want to check other options to confirm. Alternatively, maybe there\'s a way to use a different option for sha256_update_hls that has a lower area. But according to the given options, option 2 is the lowest. So the answer should be to accept this configuration.\n</think>\n\nsolution: sha256_transform_hls 0, sha256_update_hls 2', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=7729212327914150000)], created=1741052882, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2160, prompt_tokens=1105, total_tokens=3265), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.
