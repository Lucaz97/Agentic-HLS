The synthesizable function names have an extras posfix _hls. Use this name to refer to the function in the optimization process indexing the options starting from 0.
The throughput is expressed in period, the lower the better.

The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions.
This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function.
Different options use different unrolling and pipelining factors. 

The goal is to minimize the latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 40000.

Provide your first request:

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91ad66e41e004385', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, let\'s start by understanding the problem. The goal is to optimize a C application using HLS, aiming to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 40,000. The functions involved are sha256_transform_hls, sha256_update_hls, and others, each with different options affecting area, latency, and throughput.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the available options for each function. For sha256_transform_hls, there are five options. The first two have an area of 34078.8, and the next three are slightly higher at 34082.3. All have the same latency and throughput. Since the area differences are minimal, maybe choosing the first option (index 0) would be best here to keep area low.\n\nNext, sha256_update_hls has five options. The first, third, and fourth options have lower areas (around 42k and 41k) but higher latency (84). The second and fifth options have much higher areas (156k and 105k) but worse latency (433 and 5757). Since the target area is 40k, using the lower area options for sha256_update_hls is necessary. The fourth option (index 3) has the lowest area at 41743.1, which might help keep the total area closer to 40k when combined with sha256_transform_hls.\n\nWait, the total area would be the sum of the areas of all synthesized functions. But the call graph shows that sha256_update calls sha256_transform. So when synthesizing sha256_update_hls, does it include the area of sha256_transform_hls? The problem statement mentions that the values reported for a function include the child functions. So each option\'s area already accounts for the child functions used in that configuration. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of the top-level functions (main, sha256_init, sha256_update, sha256_final) and their dependencies. But main\'s options aren\'t listed here. Hmm, maybe the main function isn\'t synthesized, and the focus is on the functions with options: sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls.\n\nWait, the user provided options for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. The other functions (sha256_init, sha256_final, main) might not have options, so their area and latency are fixed or not part of the optimization. So the total area would be the sum of the areas of sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls, plus any other fixed functions. But the target is 40k. Let\'s check the areas:\n\nIf we pick sha256_transform_hls option 0 (area 34078.8) and sha256_update_hls option 3 (area 41743.1), the total would be 34078.8 + 41743.1 = 75821.9, which is way over 40k. That can\'t be right. Wait, maybe each function\'s area includes its children. For example, sha256_update_hls calls sha256_transform_hls. So if we select an option for sha256_update_hls, its area already includes the area of sha256_transform_hls as part of its synthesis. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of the top-level functions that are synthesized, considering their dependencies. But the problem statement says that the values reported for a function are obtained by synthesizing the function in isolation, including the best latency from the child functions. So when you select an option for a parent function, its area includes the child functions\' areas. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of all the synthesized functions, but if a child is included in a parent\'s synthesis, maybe it\'s not counted again. Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function." So, for example, if sha256_update_hls is synthesized with a certain option, its area includes the area of sha256_transform_hls as part of that synthesis. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of all the top-level functions that are synthesized, each including their child functions. But in this case, the main function calls sha256_init, sha256_update, etc. So if main is not synthesized, then the total area would be the sum of the areas of the functions that are synthesized. But the user hasn\'t provided options for main, so maybe the focus is on optimizing sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls, which are part of the call graph.\n\nWait, the user provided options for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. The other functions (sha256_init, sha256_final, etc.) might not have HLS options, so their area and latency are fixed. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of the synthesized functions (sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls) plus the fixed areas of the other functions. But the user hasn\'t provided their areas, so perhaps the target is to have the sum of the selected options\' areas as close to 40k as possible. But looking at the options, the sha256_transform_hls options are around 34k, and sha256_update_hls options vary from 42k to 156k. If we select the lowest area options for both, the total would be 34k + 42k = 76k, which is way over 40k. That doesn\'t make sense. Maybe there\'s a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps each function\'s area is standalone, and when they are called, their areas are added. For example, if sha256_update_hls calls sha256_transform_hls, then the total area would be the area of sha256_update_hls plus the area of sha256_transform_hls. But according to the problem statement, the area reported for sha256_update_hls includes the child functions. So if sha256_update_hls is synthesized with option X, its area already includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of the top-level functions (like main, which isn\'t synthesized here) plus the synthesized functions. But since main isn\'t synthesized, perhaps the total area is just the sum of the areas of the synthesized functions, considering that their child functions are included. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total area is the sum of the areas of all the functions that are synthesized, but if a function is called by another, its area is not counted again. For example, if sha256_update_hls includes sha256_transform_hls in its synthesis, then the total area is just the area of sha256_update_hls, as it already includes the transform. But the problem statement says that the values reported for a function include the child functions. So when you select an option for sha256_update_hls, its area includes the sha256_transform_hls area. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of the functions that are directly synthesized, which in this case might be sha256_update_hls and sha256_final_hls (if they have options), but the user hasn\'t provided options for all functions. \n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let\'s try to proceed. The user\'s goal is to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 40k. The available options for sha256_transform_hls have areas around 34k, and sha256_update_hls has options with areas ranging from ~42k to 105k. If we select the lowest area options for both, the total would be 34k + 42k = 76k, which is way over 40k. That\'s not possible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the target is for each function\'s area to be as close as possible to 40k, but that doesn\'t make sense either. Alternatively, maybe the target is for the sum of all functions\' areas to be close to 40k. But given the numbers, that\'s impossible. So perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the target, or perhaps I\'m misunderstanding the area values. Alternatively, maybe the area values are per function, and the target is the sum of all functions\' areas. But with the given options, even the smallest options sum to 34k + 42k = 76k, which is over 40k. So maybe the target is a typo, and it\'s supposed to be 400k? Or perhaps the area values are in a different unit. Alternatively, maybe the target is for the sum of the areas of the functions that are being optimized (sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls) to be close to 40k. But even their lowest combined area is 34k + 42k = 76k. That\'s still over. So this suggests that perhaps the problem statement has a mistake, or I\'m missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the area values are per instance, and the number of instances is considered. But without knowing how many times each function is called, that\'s hard to factor in. Alternatively, perhaps the area is the maximum of the individual areas, but that also doesn\'t make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the target area is per function. For example, each function\'s area should be as close as possible to 40k. But sha256_transform_hls options are around 34k, which is under, and sha256_update_hls has some options around 42k, which is close. But the problem states the total area should be as close as possible to 40k. So perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of all the functions being optimized. But with the given options, that\'s impossible. Therefore, perhaps there\'s a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I\'m misunderstanding the area values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the area values are in a different scale, like 34,078.8 is actually 34.0788 units, but that\'s unlikely given the decimal placement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the target is to have the area of each function as close as possible to 40k, but that\'s not what the problem states. The problem says "keeping the total area as close as possible to a target value."\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial options and see. Let\'s assume that the total area is the sum of the areas of the selected options for each function. For example, if we select sha256_transform_hls option 0 (34,078.8) and sha256_update_hls option 3 (41,743.1), the total area would be 34,078.8 + 41,743.1 = 75,821.9, which is way over 40k. That\'s not possible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the functions are part of a hierarchy, and the area of the parent includes the child. For example, sha256_update_hls calls sha256_transform_hls. So if we select an option for sha256_update_hls, its area already includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, the total area would be the area of sha256_update_hls (which includes transform) plus any other top-level functions. But in the call graph, main calls sha256_init, sha256_update, sha256_final. If main is not synthesized, then the total area would be the sum of the areas of sha256_init, sha256_update, sha256_final, and their dependencies. But the user hasn\'t provided options for those functions except sha256_transform and sha256_update. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only functions being optimized are sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls, and the other functions\' areas are fixed. So the total area is the sum of the areas of these two functions. But even then, their minimum sum is 34k + 42k = 76k, which is over 40k. So this suggests that the target area is impossible to meet, which can\'t be right. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: "The goal is to minimize the latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 40000." The available options for sha256_transform_hls have areas around 34k, and sha256_update_hls has options with areas from 42k to 105k. Even the smallest possible sum is 34k + 42k = 76k, which is almost double the target. This suggests that either the target is a mistake, or the area values are per function, and the target is for each function\'s area. But the problem says "total area", so that\'s not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area values are in a different unit, like LUTs or something else, and the target is 40,000 of those units. But even then, the sum is still over. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the target is for the area of a single function, not the sum. For example, optimize sha256_update_hls to have an area close to 40k. But the options for sha256_update_hls have areas starting at 42k. The closest would be option 3 with 41,743.1, which is 41.7k, which is close to 40k. But the problem states "total area", so that\'s not it.\n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the target area. Alternatively, maybe the area values are per instance, and the number of instances is considered. For example, if sha256_transform is called multiple times, but without knowing the call frequency, it\'s hard to model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to select options for each function such that the sum of their areas is as close as possible to 40k. But given the options, that\'s impossible. So maybe the user intended the target to be higher, like 80k. But the user wrote 40000. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area values are typos. For example, maybe the sha256_update_hls options have areas that are 4219.12 instead of 42191.2. That would make the sum 34k + 4.2k = 38.2k, which is close to 40k. But that\'s speculative.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial step of synthesizing a configuration to get actual area and latency values. The user\'s first step should be to select a configuration and see the results. For example, selecting the lowest area options for both functions to see what the total area and latency are. \n\nSo, for sha256_transform_hls, option 0 has area 34078.8. For sha256_update_hls, option 3 has area 41743.1. If these are the only two functions being optimized, their total area would be 34078.8 + 41743.1 = 75821.9, which is way over 40k. But maybe the actual total area is different because of the hierarchy. For example, if sha256_update_hls includes sha256_transform_hls, then the area of sha256_update_hls already includes the transform\'s area. So the total area would be just the area of sha256_update_hls (41,743.1) plus any other functions. But the problem statement says that the area reported for a function includes the child functions. So if we select sha256_update_hls option 3, its area of 41,743.1 already includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, the total area would be 41,743.1 (for sha256_update_hls, including transform) plus the areas of other functions like sha256_init and sha256_final. But the user hasn\'t provided their areas, so perhaps they are negligible or fixed. \n\nIf that\'s the case, then selecting sha256_update_hls option 3 (area 41,743.1) would be the main contributor to the total area, which is close to 40k. But 41k is still over. The closest option for sha256_update_hls is option 3 (41,743.1), which is 1.7k over. The next option is option 0 (42,191.2), which is 2.1k over. So option 3 is better. \n\nBut the problem states that the goal is to minimize latency. The latency for sha256_update_hls option 3 is 84.0, which is the lowest among its options (the other options have higher latencies). So selecting option 3 for sha256_update_hls and option 0 for sha256_transform_hls (though the transform\'s area is included in the update\'s area) might give the lowest latency with an area close to 41k. \n\nWait, but if the area of sha256_update_hls already includes the transform\'s area, then selecting different options for transform would not affect the update\'s area. But the problem statement says that selecting a different option for a child function will affect the parent\'s outcome. So perhaps the options for sha256_transform_hls are part of the options for sha256_update_hls. For example, when you select an option for sha256_update_hls, it uses a specific version of sha256_transform_hls. But the user provided separate options for each function. This is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, the options for sha256_transform_hls are independent, and when sha256_update_hls is synthesized, it uses the selected option of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of sha256_transform_hls (selected option) and sha256_update_hls (selected option), because each is synthesized separately. But that would lead to a higher total area. \n\nThis is a critical point. If the functions are synthesized separately, their areas are additive. If they are synthesized together, the parent\'s area includes the child\'s. The problem statement says that the values reported for a function include the child functions. So when you synthesize sha256_update_hls, its area includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, if you select an option for sha256_update_hls, you don\'t need to select an option for sha256_transform_hls separately, because it\'s already included. But the user provided options for both functions, which suggests that they can be optimized independently. \n\nThis is conflicting. The problem statement says: "the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function." So if you select a different option for the child function (sha256_transform_hls), it will affect the parent\'s (sha256_update_hls) area and latency. Therefore, the parent\'s reported area and latency depend on the child\'s selected option. \n\nThis means that when you choose an option for sha256_transform_hls, it affects the area and latency of sha256_update_hls. But the user provided fixed options for sha256_update_hls, which suggests that those options already include a specific version of the child function. Therefore, the options for sha256_update_hls are independent of the options for sha256_transform_hls. This is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, the options for sha256_update_hls are different implementations that may use different options for sha256_transform_hls. For example, option 0 of sha256_update_hls uses option 0 of sha256_transform_hls, and option 1 uses a different option. But the user hasn\'t provided that information. \n\nGiven this ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial synthesis of a configuration to see the actual total area and latency. For example, select sha256_transform_hls option 0 and sha256_update_hls option 3. Then, based on the result, adjust the choices. \n\nBut the user\'s first step is to provide the first request. Since the goal is to minimize latency while keeping area close to 40k, and the lowest latency for sha256_update_hls is 84.0 (options 0, 2, 3), with areas around 42k. The sha256_transform_hls options all have the same latency, so choosing the lowest area option (0) makes sense. \n\nSo the first request should be to synthesize sha256_transform_hls option 0 and sha256_update_hls option 3. The total area would be the sum of their areas if they are synthesized separately, but according to the problem statement, the parent\'s area includes the child\'s. Therefore, if sha256_update_hls includes sha256_transform_hls, then the area of sha256_update_hls option 3 (41,743.1) already includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, the total area would be 41,743.1, which is close to 40k. That\'s a 1.7k over, which is the closest possible given the options. \n\nTherefore, the first step is to synthesize this configuration to get the actual total area and latency. If the area is indeed around 41.7k and latency 84, that\'s a good starting point. Then, perhaps explore other options to see if a lower area is possible without increasing latency too much. \n\nSo the first action is to synthesize: sha256_transform_hls 0 and sha256_update_hls 3. But wait, the problem says that the synthesizable function names have an _hls suffix. The functions in the call graph are sha256_transform, which is implemented by sha256_transform_hls. So when synthesizing sha256_update_hls, which calls sha256_transform, it would use the _hls version. Therefore, the options for sha256_transform_hls are part of the synthesis of sha256_update_hls. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, each function\'s options include the child functions. So the area of sha256_update_hls option 3 includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, selecting sha256_update_hls option 3 would already include the transform\'s area. Therefore, the total area would be just the area of sha256_update_hls (41,743.1) plus any other functions that are synthesized. But the other functions (sha256_init, sha256_final, main) are not listed with options, so their areas are fixed and not part of the optimization. \n\nIf that\'s the case, then the total area is 41,743.1, which is close to 40k. The latency would be 84.0 (from sha256_update_hls) plus any latency from other functions. But the goal is to minimize the total latency, which is likely dominated by sha256_update_hls. \n\nTherefore, the first step is to synthesize sha256_update_hls option 3 and sha256_transform_hls option 0. But since the area of sha256_update_hls already includes the transform\'s area, perhaps selecting the transform\'s option is redundant. This is unclear. \n\nAlternatively, the options for sha256_transform_hls are separate, and when synthesizing sha256_update_hls, you need to specify which option of the transform to use. But the user hasn\'t provided that information. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, the safest first step is to synthesize the configuration with the lowest possible area for both functions, even if the sum exceeds 40k, to get actual data. So the first request would be:\n\nsynthesis: sha256_transform_hls 0, sha256_update_hls 3\n\nThis selects the lowest area options for both functions. The total area would be 34,078.8 + 41,743.1 = 75,821.9, which is way over 40k. But perhaps the actual total area is different due to hierarchy inclusion. \n\nAlternatively, if the area of sha256_update_hls already includes the transform\'s area, then selecting option 3 for sha256_update_hls would have an area of 41,743.1, which includes the transform\'s area. Therefore, the total area is 41,743.1, which is closer to 40k. \n\nIn that case, the first step is to synthesize sha256_update_hls option 3, and since it includes the transform, we don\'t need to synthesize the transform separately. But the user provided options for both functions, so perhaps they are synthesized separately. \n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time constraints, I\'ll proceed with the initial synthesis request as mentioned, and see what the result is. The user can then provide feedback on the actual area and latency, which will clarify the hierarchy.\n</think>\n\nsynthesis: sha256_transform_hls 0, sha256_update_hls 3', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=2770192226044900400)], created=1741049662, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5225, prompt_tokens=929, total_tokens=6154), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91ad69dc7d95f795', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, let\'s see. The user wants to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 40,000. The last synthesis attempt used sha256_transform_hls option 0 and sha256_update_hls option 3. The area reported after assignment is 41,743.1, which is a bit over the target. The latency for sha256_update_hls here is 84.0. \n\nLooking at the options for sha256_update_hls, option 3 has an area of 41,743.1 and latency 84. Option 0 for the same function has an area of 42,191.2, which is higher. Option 4 has a much higher area (105k) but worse latency. Option 1 has a much higher area (156k) but worse latency. So option 3 seems better in terms of area compared to others except maybe option 2. Wait, option 2 for sha256_update_hls is area 42,191.2, same as option 0. Hmm, maybe there\'s a typo here. But the user\'s data shows option 3 as 41,743.1, which is the lowest area for sha256_update_hls.\n\nThe sha256_transform_hls options all have similar areas around 34k. The first two options are 34,078.8, and the next three are 34,082.3. Their latencies are all 80.0. So choosing any of them doesn\'t affect latency much, but maybe the area can be slightly optimized. However, the main area contributor here is sha256_update_hls. \n\nThe total area from the last synthesis is 41,743.1, which is 17% over the target of 40k. To get closer, maybe we can try a different combination. Let\'s check if there\'s a way to reduce the area further. \n\nLooking at sha256_update_hls options, option 3 is the lowest area (41,743.1). The next step is to see if combining it with a lower area option for sha256_transform_hls. For example, sha256_transform_hls option 0 has area 34,078.8. Adding that to sha256_update_hls option 3\'s area: 34,078.8 + 41,743.1 = 75,821.9. Wait, but the total area reported was 41,743.1. Wait, maybe the area numbers are per function, and the total is the sum of all functions used. But in the last synthesis, the total area was 41,743.1, which might be just the sha256_update_hls area, since sha256_transform is a child function. Wait, the problem statement says that when synthesizing a function, the child functions are included. So if we synthesize sha256_update_hls, which calls sha256_transform, then the area of sha256_update_hls includes the area of sha256_transform. So the total area is the sum of the areas of all top-level functions synthesized. Wait, but the user\'s initial data lists options for each function. For example, sha256_update_hls has options, and when you select an option for it, it includes the child functions (like sha256_transform). So the area reported for sha256_update_hls option 3 (41,743.1) already includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, the total area is just the sum of the areas of the top-level functions (main, sha256_init, sha256_update, sha256_final, etc.), but in the problem statement, the main function\'s options aren\'t listed. Wait, the functions with options are those with _hls suffix. The call graph shows that main calls sha256_init, sha256_update, etc. But the options provided are for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. So perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of all the functions that are synthesized with their options. For example, if sha256_update_hls is synthesized with option 3, which includes sha256_transform_hls (as a child), then the area of sha256_update_hls option 3 already includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of all the top-level functions that are synthesized. But in the given data, the options are for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. Wait, the problem statement says that the values reported for a function are obtained by synthesizing the function in isolation, including the child functions. So when you select an option for sha256_update_hls, its area includes the area of sha256_transform_hls (as a child). Therefore, the total area of the entire application would be the sum of the areas of all the top-level functions (like main, sha256_init, sha256_update, sha256_final) each with their selected options. But in the given data, the only functions with options are sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. Wait, the user provided options for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. The other functions (sha256_init, sha256_final, main) might not have options, or their options are not provided. So the total area would be the sum of the areas of sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls, plus any other functions that are synthesized. But according to the call graph, sha256_final calls sha256_transform and memset. If memset is not synthesized, then its area isn\'t considered. But the problem statement says that the options are for the functions with _hls suffix. So perhaps only sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls have options, and the others are not synthesized, so their area is fixed. Alternatively, maybe the main function and others are not part of the HLS synthesis, and only the functions with _hls are. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement. \n\nThe user says: "The synthesizable function names have an extra suffix _hls. Use this name to refer to the function in the optimization process indexing the options starting from 0." So only the functions with _hls are being synthesized. The call graph shows that sha256_update calls sha256_transform, which has a _hls version. So when synthesizing sha256_update_hls, it includes the sha256_transform_hls as a child. Therefore, the area of sha256_update_hls option 3 (41,743.1) includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. So the total area of the application would be the sum of the areas of all the synthesized functions. But in the given data, the options are for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. However, the user\'s goal is to select options for these functions to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 40,000. \n\nWait, the last synthesis result for sha256_update_hls option 3 gave a total area of 41,743.1. But according to the problem statement, the area of sha256_update_hls option 3 is 41,743.1, which already includes the sha256_transform_hls\'s area. So if we select sha256_transform_hls option 0 (area 34,078.8), but since sha256_update_hls includes sha256_transform_hls, perhaps the total area is just the area of sha256_update_hls (41,743.1) plus any other functions that are synthesized. But the problem statement says that the values reported for a function are obtained by synthesizing the function in isolation, including the child functions. So when you select an option for sha256_update_hls, its area includes the child functions (like sha256_transform_hls). Therefore, the total area of the application would be the sum of the areas of all the top-level functions that are synthesized. For example, if main is synthesized, but in this case, the options are only for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. \n\nWait, the call graph shows that main calls sha256_init, sha256_update, sha256_final, and printf. But the options are for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. So perhaps the only synthesized functions are sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. But sha256_update_hls includes sha256_transform_hls as a child. Therefore, the total area would be the area of sha256_update_hls (which includes sha256_transform_hls) plus any other synthesized functions. But if sha256_final also calls sha256_transform_hls, then perhaps the area of sha256_final would include another instance of sha256_transform_hls. But according to the problem statement, when synthesizing a function, the child functions are included. So if sha256_final is synthesized, its area would include sha256_transform_hls. However, in the given data, there are no options provided for sha256_final_hls. So perhaps only sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls are being optimized. \n\nThis is a bit unclear, but given the data, the user\'s last synthesis was for sha256_update_hls option 3, which resulted in a total area of 41,743.1. The target is 40,000. So we need to find a way to reduce the area further. \n\nLooking at the options for sha256_update_hls, option 3 is the lowest area (41,743.1). The next option is option 2 with area 42,191.2, which is higher. So option 3 is the best for area in sha256_update_hls. \n\nFor sha256_transform_hls, the options have areas around 34k. But since sha256_transform is a child of sha256_update, the area of sha256_update_hls already includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, changing the option for sha256_transform_hls might not affect the total area if sha256_update_hls\'s option already includes a specific version of sha256_transform_hls. Wait, but the problem statement says that when you select an option for a parent function, the child functions are included. So if we select sha256_update_hls option 3, which includes sha256_transform_hls, but the user also selects a different option for sha256_transform_hls, does that override? Or is the sha256_transform_hls option determined by the parent\'s synthesis? \n\nThis is a critical point. The problem statement says: "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function." \n\nAh, so when you select an option for a parent function (like sha256_update_hls), the child functions (like sha256_transform_hls) are synthesized as part of that parent\'s options. Therefore, the area and latency of the parent function\'s option already include the child\'s implementation. Therefore, if we select a different option for the child function (sha256_transform_hls), it would require re-synthesizing the parent function (sha256_update_hls) with that child option, which would change the parent\'s area and latency. \n\nBut in the current setup, the user is to select options for each function, including the child functions. So for example, if we choose sha256_transform_hls option 0 and sha256_update_hls option 3, does that mean that sha256_update_hls is synthesized with sha256_transform_hls option 0, which might change its area and latency? \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The problem statement says that the options for the functions are indexed, and each function\'s options include the child functions. So when you select an option for sha256_update_hls, it\'s a specific implementation that includes a certain version of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, the options for sha256_update_hls already encapsulate the choices for sha256_transform_hls. But the user is given separate options for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls, which suggests that they can be selected independently. \n\nThis is a contradiction. If the parent function\'s options include the child\'s implementation, then selecting a different option for the child would require the parent\'s option to be re-synthesized. But the user is given fixed options for each function, implying that the options are pre-synthesized with certain child configurations. \n\nGiven the data provided, the options for sha256_transform_hls are separate from those of sha256_update_hls. For example, sha256_transform_hls has 5 options, and sha256_update_hls has 5 options. The user needs to select an option for each function. However, since sha256_update_hls calls sha256_transform_hls, the area and latency of sha256_update_hls\'s options must already include the chosen sha256_transform_hls\'s option. But according to the problem statement, when a function is synthesized, it includes the child functions. Therefore, the options for sha256_update_hls must have been synthesized with specific options for sha256_transform_hls. \n\nBut the user is allowed to select options for both functions independently. This suggests that the options for sha256_update_hls are synthesized with the best possible options for their child functions (as per the problem statement: "selecting the best latency from the child functions"). Therefore, when you select an option for sha256_update_hls, it uses the best possible (lowest latency) option for sha256_transform_hls. But the user can override this by selecting a specific option for sha256_transform_hls, which would then affect the parent\'s synthesis. \n\nThis is a bit unclear, but given the problem statement, the user is to select options for each function, and the parent functions\' options include the child functions. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of all selected functions. But this may not be the case if the parent\'s area already includes the child\'s area. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each function\'s area is standalone, and when a parent function calls a child, the total area is the sum of both. But that would lead to double-counting if the child is used in multiple parents. \n\nThis is a critical point. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \n\n"The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function."\n\nSo when you synthesize a parent function, it includes the child functions. Therefore, the area of the parent function includes the area of the child functions. Therefore, if you select a parent function\'s option, you don\'t need to separately select the child\'s option because it\'s already included. However, the problem allows selecting options for both parent and child functions, which suggests that the child\'s option can be chosen independently, and the parent\'s synthesis would use that child\'s option. \n\nThis is conflicting. The problem statement says that the parent\'s options include the child\'s best options (for latency), but the user can select specific options for the child, which would override the parent\'s default choice. \n\nGiven that the user is allowed to select options for both functions, the correct approach is to model the total area as the sum of the areas of all selected functions, considering that child functions are included in the parent\'s area. But this would lead to double-counting. Alternatively, the total area is the sum of the areas of the top-level functions, which include their children. \n\nIn the previous synthesis, the user selected sha256_transform_hls 0 and sha256_update_hls 3. The resulting area was 41,743.1. Looking at the options, sha256_update_hls option 3 has an area of 41,743.1, which likely includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. But sha256_transform_hls option 0 has an area of 34,078.8. If the total area is the sum of both, that would be 75k, which is way over. But the reported area was 41k. Therefore, the area of sha256_update_hls option 3 must already include the area of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, when selecting options for both functions, the parent\'s area includes the child\'s area. Therefore, selecting a different option for the child would require the parent\'s area to be re-synthesized with that child option, which would change the parent\'s area and latency. \n\nBut the problem statement says that the options for each function are pre-synthesized with the best child options. Therefore, the user cannot independently select the child\'s option; the parent\'s option already includes the child\'s best option. However, the user is given the ability to select options for both, which suggests that the parent\'s options are synthesized with specific child options. \n\nThis is a bit of a confusion in the problem setup. To proceed, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that each function\'s options are independent, and the total area is the sum of all selected functions\' areas. But given that the parent functions call the child functions, this would lead to double-counting. Alternatively, the total area is the maximum of the areas, but that doesn\'t make sense. \n\nAlternatively, the total area is the sum of the areas of all functions that are roots in the call graph (i.e., functions not called by any other function). In this case, main is the root, which calls sha256_init, sha256_update, etc. But main\'s options are not provided, so perhaps the area is only considered for the functions with options (sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls). \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the data provided. The user\'s last synthesis selected sha256_transform_hls 0 and sha256_update_hls 3, resulting in a total area of 41,743.1. The target is 40,000. To reduce the area, we need to find a configuration that lowers the area. \n\nLooking at the options for sha256_update_hls, the lowest area is option 3 (41,743.1). The next option is option 2 (42,191.2), which is higher. So option 3 is the best for area. For sha256_transform_hls, the options have areas around 34k, but since the parent function\'s area includes the child\'s, changing the transform\'s option might not affect the total area. \n\nWait, but if the parent\'s area includes the child\'s, then selecting a different child option would require the parent\'s area to change. For example, if sha256_update_hls option 3 uses sha256_transform_hls option 0, but we select sha256_transform_hls option 1, which has the same area, then the total area remains the same. But if the parent\'s option was synthesized with a specific child option, changing the child\'s option would require re-synthesizing the parent, which might change its area and latency. \n\nHowever, the user is given fixed options for each function. So each option for sha256_update_hls is pre-synthesized with a specific child option. Therefore, the user cannot mix and match; selecting a parent option fixes the child\'s option. But the problem allows the user to select options for both, which suggests that the child\'s option can be chosen independently. \n\nThis is a contradiction. To resolve this, perhaps the correct interpretation is that each function\'s options are independent, and the total area is the sum of all selected functions\' areas. However, this would mean that if a parent function calls a child function, the total area includes both, leading to double-counting. But in reality, the child\'s logic is part of the parent\'s implementation, so their areas should not be summed. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial assumption that the total area is the sum of the areas of the selected functions. But in the previous synthesis, selecting sha256_transform_hls 0 and sha256_update_hls 3 resulted in a total area of 41,743.1, which matches the area of sha256_update_hls option 3. This suggests that the parent\'s area includes the child\'s area. Therefore, when selecting a parent option, the child\'s area is already included, and selecting a child option is redundant. \n\nBut the problem allows selecting options for both, which implies that the child\'s option can be chosen, affecting the parent\'s synthesis. Therefore, the correct approach is that selecting a child\'s option changes the parent\'s implementation, thus affecting the parent\'s area and latency. \n\nIn that case, the user needs to select options for both the parent and child functions, and the total area would be the sum of the areas of the top-level functions (those not called by any other function). But in the call graph, main is the root, which calls other functions. However, main\'s options are not provided, so perhaps the area is only for the functions with options (sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls). \n\nAlternatively, the total area is the sum of the areas of all functions with options selected. For example, if you select sha256_transform_hls option 0 and sha256_update_hls option 3, the total area is 34,078.8 + 41,743.1 = 75,821.9. But the previous synthesis reported a total area of 41,743.1, which suggests that the parent\'s area includes the child\'s. Therefore, the correct total area is just the area of the parent function (sha256_update_hls) when it\'s synthesized, which includes the child\'s area. \n\nBut then why are there options for sha256_transform_hls? If the parent\'s area includes the child\'s, then selecting a different option for the child would require re-synthesizing the parent, which would change the parent\'s area and latency. However, the user is given fixed options for the parent, which suggests that the parent\'s options are pre-synthesized with certain child options. \n\nThis is a key point. The problem statement says: "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." This means that when a parent function is synthesized, it uses the best possible (lowest latency) option for the child functions. Therefore, the parent\'s options are synthesized with the child\'s best options. Therefore, the user cannot independently select the child\'s option; the parent\'s option already includes the best child option. \n\nBut the user is given options for both parent and child functions, which suggests that they can be selected independently. This is conflicting. \n\nGiven the problem statement\'s instruction, the correct approach is that the parent\'s options are synthesized with the best child options (for latency). Therefore, when the user selects a parent option, the child\'s option is automatically chosen to be the one that gives the parent the best latency. Therefore, the user does not need to select child options; they are determined by the parent\'s selection. \n\nHowever, the user is provided with options for both functions, which implies that they can be selected. This suggests that the problem allows the user to override the child\'s option, which would affect the parent\'s synthesis. \n\nGiven this ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed by selecting options for both functions and seeing how the total area and latency change. \n\nIn the previous synthesis, selecting sha256_transform_hls 0 and sha256_update_hls 3 resulted in a total area of 41,743.1. The target is 40,000. To get closer, perhaps we can try a different combination. \n\nLooking at the options for sha256_update_hls, option 4 has a much higher area (105k) and worse latency, so it\'s not suitable. Option 1 has 156k area, which is way over. Options 0, 2, and 3 are around 42k, 42k, and 41.7k. So option 3 is the best for area. \n\nFor sha256_transform_hls, all options have similar areas (around 34k), but perhaps selecting a different option could slightly reduce the area. For example, option 0 has 34,078.8, which is the lowest. But if the parent\'s area includes the child\'s, then changing the child\'s option would require re-synthesizing the parent, which might change the parent\'s area. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the parent\'s options are pre-synthesized with the best child options. Therefore, the user cannot select a child option independently; the parent\'s option already includes the best child option. Therefore, the user should only select options for the parent functions, and the child options are automatically chosen. \n\nBut the user\'s initial message allowed selecting options for both functions, which suggests that they can be chosen independently. This is confusing. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed by trying different combinations of the parent and child options to see how the area and latency change. \n\nThe previous attempt used sha256_transform_hls 0 and sha256_update_hls 3, resulting in area 41,743.1. To get closer to 40k, perhaps we need to find a way to reduce the area further. \n\nLooking at the options for sha256_update_hls, there\'s no option with area lower than 41k. Therefore, it\'s impossible to reach 40k with the given options. However, the target is to get as close as possible. The closest option is 41,743.1, which is 1,743 over. \n\nAlternatively, maybe combining different options for the child and parent can help. For example, if we select sha256_update_hls option 3 (area 41,743.1) and sha256_transform_hls option 0 (area 34,078.8), but if the parent\'s area already includes the child\'s, then the total area is 41,743.1. If not, then the total would be 34k + 41k = 75k, which is way over. But the previous synthesis result was 41k, suggesting that the parent\'s area includes the child\'s. \n\nTherefore, the total area is just the area of the parent function (sha256_update_hls) when synthesized, which includes the child\'s area. Therefore, selecting different child options would require re-synthesizing the parent, which would change the parent\'s area and latency. \n\nBut the user is given fixed options for the parent, which implies that the parent\'s options are pre-synthesized with certain child options. Therefore, the user cannot change the child\'s option once the parent\'s option is selected. \n\nThis is a critical point. If the parent\'s options are pre-synthesized with the best child options, then the user only needs to select the parent\'s options, and the child\'s options are automatically chosen. However, the problem allows the user to select options for both, which suggests that they can be chosen independently. \n\nGiven the problem\'s instructions, the user must select options for each function, including child functions. Therefore, the total area is the sum of the areas of all selected functions. However, this would lead to double-counting if a child is called by multiple parents. \n\nIn this case, sha256_transform_hls is called by sha256_update_hls and sha256_final_hls. If the user selects an option for sha256_transform_hls, it would affect all parents that call it. But the problem statement doesn\'t provide options for sha256_final_hls, so perhaps it\'s not synthesized, or its area is fixed. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial strategy: select the lowest area options for both functions to get as close as possible to the target. \n\nBut in the previous attempt, the area was 41,743.1. The next step could be to try a different combination, but there\'s no lower area option for sha256_update_hls. Therefore, the best possible area is 41,743.1, which is the closest to 40k. \n\nHowever, the user\'s goal is to minimize latency while keeping the area as close as possible to 40k. The latency for sha256_update_hls option 3 is 84.0. Are there other options with lower latency? \n\nLooking at the options for sha256_update_hls:\n\n- Option 0: latency 84, area 42,191.2\n\n- Option 1: latency 433, area 156k\n\n- Option 2: latency 84, area 42,191.2\n\n- Option 3: latency 84, area 41,743.1\n\n- Option 4: latency 5757, area 105k\n\nSo the lowest latency is 84.0 for options 0, 2, 3. Among these, option 3 has the lowest area. Therefore, the best configuration for sha256_update_hls is option 3. \n\nFor sha256_transform_hls, all options have latency 80.0, so selecting any of them doesn\'t affect latency. The area differences are minimal (34,078.8 vs 34,082.3). The lowest area is option 0. \n\nTherefore, the best configuration is sha256_transform_hls 0 and sha256_update_hls 3, which was already tried, resulting in area 41,743.1. Since this is the closest to 40k, perhaps this is the solution. \n\nBut the user might want to explore if there\'s a way to get a lower area. However, given the options, it\'s not possible. Therefore, the solution is to accept this configuration. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can try to run a Python script using OR-Tools to find the optimal combination. The script would need to minimize latency while keeping the area as close as possible to 40k. \n\nThe variables are the options for each function. For sha256_transform_hls, there are 5 options, all with latency 80 and area around 34k. For sha256_update_hls, 5 options with varying latencies and areas. \n\nThe total area is the sum of the areas of the selected options. Wait, but if the parent\'s area includes the child\'s, then the total area is just the area of the parent (sha256_update_hls) plus any other top-level functions. But if sha256_transform_hls is also used by other functions (like sha256_final), then its area would be included in those parents as well. \n\nThis complicates the model. However, given the problem\'s data, perhaps the only functions with options are sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. Therefore, the total area is the sum of their selected options\' areas. \n\nBut in the previous synthesis, selecting both resulted in an area of 41k, which is less than the sum of their individual areas (34k + 41k = 75k). Therefore, the correct model is that the parent\'s area includes the child\'s area. \n\nThus, the total area is just the area of the parent function (sha256_update_hls) when it\'s synthesized, which includes the child\'s area. Therefore, selecting a different option for the child would require re-synthesizing the parent, which would change the parent\'s area and latency. \n\nBut the user is given fixed options for the parent, which implies that the parent\'s options are pre-synthesized with certain child options. Therefore, the user cannot independently select the child\'s option. \n\nThis is a contradiction. The problem statement allows selecting options for both functions, but the parent\'s options include the child\'s. \n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the initial configuration and accept it as the solution, since it\'s the closest to the target area with the lowest latency. \n\nTherefore, the final answer would be to accept the configuration sha256_transform_hls 0 and sha256_update_hls 3.\n</think>\n\nsolution: sha256_transform_hls 0, sha256_update_hls 3', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=6004129390663731000)], created=1741049783, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6758, prompt_tokens=1107, total_tokens=7865), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.
