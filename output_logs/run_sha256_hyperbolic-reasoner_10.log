This is the call graph for the application at hand:
{'sha256_transform': [], 'sha256_init': [], 'sha256_update': ['sha256_transform'], 'sha256_final': ['sha256_transform', 'memset', 'sha256_transform'], 'main': ['sha256_init', 'sha256_update', 'sha256_final', 'printf']}

The application has the following functions with their respective options:
Option for sha256_transform_hls -  area: 34078.8, latency: 80.0, throughput: 83.0
Option for sha256_transform_hls -  area: 34078.8, latency: 80.0, throughput: 83.0
Option for sha256_transform_hls -  area: 34082.3, latency: 80.0, throughput: 83.0
Option for sha256_transform_hls -  area: 34082.3, latency: 80.0, throughput: 83.0
Option for sha256_transform_hls -  area: 34082.3, latency: 80.0, throughput: 83.0
Option for sha256_update_hls -  area: 42191.2, latency: 84.0, throughput: 86.0

Option for sha256_update_hls -  area: 105109.3, latency: 5757.0, throughput: 5759.0


The synthesizable function names have an extras posfix _hls. Use this name to refer to the function in the optimization process indexing the options starting from 0.
The throughput is expressed in period, the lower the better.

The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions.
This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function.
Different options use different unrolling and pipelining factors. 

The goal is to minimize the latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 40000.

Provide your first request:

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91ad712dda91429b', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, let\'s start by understanding the problem. The goal is to optimize a C application using HLS, aiming to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 40,000. The functions involved are sha256_transform_hls, sha256_update_hls, and others, each with different options affecting area, latency, and throughput.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the available options for each function. The sha256_transform_hls has five options, all with similar areas around 34,000 and the same latency and throughput. That\'s interestingâ€”maybe these options differ in other aspects, but the provided data shows the same metrics. So selecting any of them might not affect latency much, but perhaps area varies slightly. The first two options have area 34078.8, the next three 34082.3. The difference is minimal, so maybe choosing the first option (index 0) for sha256_transform_hls would be a starting point.\n\nThen, sha256_update_hls has five options. The areas here vary a lot. The first, third, and fourth options have areas around 42,000, 41,743, and 105,109 respectively. The latencies are 84, 84, 84, and 5757. The second option has a much higher area (156,387) and latency (433). The fifth option (index 4) has a very high latency of 5757, which is bad for our goal of minimizing latency. So the best options for sha256_update_hls in terms of latency are indices 0, 2, and 3 with latency 84. However, their areas are around 42k, which when combined with sha256_transform\'s 34k would total around 76k, which is way over the target of 40k. Wait, that can\'t be right. Wait, maybe I\'m misunderstanding the area reporting. Are these areas for the entire application or per function? The problem statement says the values are when the function is synthesized in isolation, including child functions. So if sha256_update_hls includes sha256_transform_hls, then the area for sha256_update_hls already includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Wait, the user said: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis." So when we select an option for sha256_update_hls, its area already includes the area of sha256_transform_hls (since sha256_update calls sha256_transform). Similarly, sha256_final calls sha256_transform and others. But the main function calls sha256_init, update, final, etc. Wait, but the options provided are for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. So the total area would be the sum of the areas of all the functions that are synthesized with their selected options. Wait, no. Because when you synthesize a parent function, it includes the child functions. So if we have sha256_update_hls which calls sha256_transform_hls, then the area of sha256_update_hls includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. But if we also have sha256_final_hls which calls sha256_transform_hls, then the area for sha256_final_hls would include another instance of sha256_transform_hls. But that\'s not possible because in HLS, each function is synthesized once. Wait, maybe the area reported for each function is the area of that function plus all its children. So if we select options for both sha256_update_hls and sha256_final_hls, which both call sha256_transform_hls, then the total area would be the sum of the areas of sha256_update_hls (including sha256_transform) and sha256_final_hls (including another sha256_transform). But that would double-count the sha256_transform area. That can\'t be right. Hmm, perhaps the area for each function is only the area of that function, not including children. But the user said that when synthesizing a function in isolation, the child functions are included. So maybe the area reported for sha256_update_hls is the total area when synthesizing it, which includes the sha256_transform_hls it calls. Similarly, sha256_final_hls would include its own calls to sha256_transform_hls. But in the application, when all functions are synthesized together, the total area would be the sum of the areas of each top-level function (main, which calls others), but that\'s not how HLS works. Wait, perhaps the main function is the top-level, and when synthesizing main, all called functions are included. But the options here are for individual functions. This is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe user says: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function." So when a parent function is synthesized, it uses the child functions\' options. But if a child function is called by multiple parents, how is that handled? For example, sha256_transform is called by sha256_update and sha256_final. If we select an option for sha256_transform_hls, does that affect both parents? Or does each parent have their own instance? The problem statement isn\'t clear. But given that the options are per function, perhaps each function\'s options are chosen once, and all instances of that function in the call graph use the same option. So if sha256_transform_hls is called by multiple parents, the same option is used for all calls. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of all the functions that are synthesized with their options. Wait, but when synthesizing the entire application, the top-level function (main) would include all the called functions. So the total area would be the sum of the areas of all the functions that are part of the design. But each function\'s area includes its children. Wait, no. If you synthesize a function in isolation, its area includes the children. But when synthesizing the entire application, the top-level function\'s area includes all the children. So if we have main calling sha256_init, sha256_update, sha256_final, etc., then the total area would be the area of main, which includes all the sub-functions. But the options provided are for individual functions. So perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of each function\'s selected option, but considering that some functions are children of others. This is getting complicated. Maybe the user expects that the total area is the sum of the areas of the functions that are selected, but considering that some functions are called by others. For example, if sha256_update_hls is selected with an option that includes sha256_transform_hls, then the area of sha256_update_hls already includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. But if sha256_final_hls also calls sha256_transform_hls, then the area of sha256_final_hls would include another instance of sha256_transform_hls. But that\'s not possible in hardware; functions are instantiated once. So perhaps the total area is the maximum of the areas of the functions, but that doesn\'t make sense. Alternatively, the total area is the sum of the areas of all the functions that are part of the design, but each function\'s area is only its own, not including children. But the problem statement says that when a function is synthesized in isolation, the child functions are included. So the area reported for sha256_update_hls includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, if we select sha256_update_hls and sha256_final_hls, which both call sha256_transform_hls, the total area would be the area of sha256_update_hls (including sha256_transform) plus the area of sha256_final_hls (including another sha256_transform). But that would count sha256_transform twice, which isn\'t correct. This suggests that the problem\'s area calculation might be incorrect, but perhaps the user expects us to proceed under the assumption that each function\'s area includes its children, and the total area is the sum of the top-level functions\' areas. For example, main is the top-level function, which calls sha256_init, sha256_update, sha256_final. So the total area would be the area of main, which includes all the sub-functions. But the options provided are for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. Wait, the functions listed are sha256_transform, sha256_init, etc., but the options are for their _hls versions. So perhaps the main function is not synthesized, and the synthesizable functions are the ones with _hls suffix. The call graph shows that main calls sha256_init, which is not listed with options. So maybe only sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls have options. Wait, looking back: the application has functions with options as sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. The other functions (sha256_init, sha256_final, main) might not have options, or their options are not provided. So the problem is to select options for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls, and possibly others, but according to the given data, only these two have options. Wait, the user wrote: "The application has the following functions with their respective options:" followed by options for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. So other functions like sha256_final_hls may not have options, or their options are not provided. Therefore, the only functions we can select options for are sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. The other functions (sha256_init, sha256_final, main) are not part of the options. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls, but considering that sha256_update_hls includes sha256_transform_hls. Wait, no. Because when sha256_update_hls is synthesized, it includes the sha256_transform_hls. So if we select an option for sha256_update_hls, its area already includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Similarly, if sha256_final_hls is synthesized, it would include sha256_transform_hls again. But since the options are only for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls, perhaps the other functions (like sha256_final_hls) are not part of the optimization and their area is fixed. This is getting confusing. Let me try to clarify.\n\nThe problem states that the goal is to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 40,000. The functions with options are sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. Let\'s assume that these are the only functions we can choose options for. The other functions (sha256_init, sha256_final, main) are not part of the options, so their area is fixed and not included in the total. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the selected options\' areas for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. But wait, the options for sha256_update_hls have areas around 42k, 156k, etc. If we select sha256_transform_hls option 0 (area ~34k) and sha256_update_hls option 0 (area ~42k), the total area would be 34k + 42k = 76k, which is way over the target of 40k. That can\'t be right. Therefore, my initial assumption must be wrong. \n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the area reported for each function is the area of that function alone, not including its children. But when synthesizing the entire application, the total area is the sum of all functions\' areas. However, the problem statement says that when a function is synthesized in isolation, the child functions are included. So the area reported for sha256_update_hls includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, if we select sha256_update_hls option 0 (area 42k), that already includes the sha256_transform_hls area. But then, if sha256_final_hls also calls sha256_transform_hls, does that mean another instance of sha256_transform_hls is added? That would lead to duplication. But in HLS, functions are synthesized once, so the area should be counted once. Therefore, the total area would be the maximum of the areas of the functions that include their children. But this is unclear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of all the functions that are roots in the call graph. For example, main is the top function, so its area includes all others. But main isn\'t listed with options. The options are for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. Maybe the total area is the sum of the areas of the functions we select options for. But that doesn\'t make sense. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial data. The target area is 40k. The options for sha256_transform_hls have areas around 34k, and sha256_update_hls options have areas ranging from ~42k to 105k. If we select sha256_transform_hls option 0 (34k) and sha256_update_hls option 3 (41,743.1), the total area would be 34k + 41.7k = ~75.7k, which is over the target. But the target is 40k. This suggests that perhaps the area values are not additive. Maybe the area of the entire application is the area of the top-level function, which includes all the sub-functions. For example, if main is the top-level function, and it calls sha256_update_hls and others, then the area of main would include all the sub-functions. But main\'s options are not provided. Alternatively, perhaps the functions with options are the ones that contribute to the total area. For example, if we select options for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls, their areas are the main contributors. But given that the target is 40k, and the sha256_transform_hls options are around 34k, perhaps selecting a lower area option for sha256_update_hls is necessary. But the sha256_update_hls options with lower area are around 42k, which when added to 34k would exceed 40k. This suggests that there\'s a misunderstanding. \n\nWait, maybe the area values are per function, and the total area is the sum of all functions\' areas. But if sha256_update_hls includes sha256_transform_hls, then adding both would double-count. Therefore, the correct total area would be the area of the top-level function (main) which includes all others. But since main\'s area isn\'t provided, perhaps the problem is simplified, and the total area is the sum of the areas of the functions with options. But that doesn\'t align with the target of 40k. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area values are standalone, and the total area is just the sum of the selected options. For example, if we select sha256_transform_hls option 0 (34,078.8) and sha256_update_hls option 3 (41,743.1), the total is 75,821.9, which is way over 40k. This can\'t be right. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. \n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: "The goal is to minimize the latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to a target value." The target is 40,000. The options for sha256_transform_hls have areas around 34k, and sha256_update_hls options have areas from ~42k to 105k. If we have to choose one option for each function, the sum would be way over 40k. Therefore, perhaps the area values are not additive. Maybe each function\'s area is the total area when that function is synthesized, including its children. So if we select sha256_update_hls option 0 (area 42,191.2), which includes sha256_transform_hls, then the total area is 42,191.2, and the sha256_transform_hls option is irrelevant because it\'s included in the sha256_update_hls area. But then, if another function like sha256_final_hls also calls sha256_transform_hls, would that add to the area? This is unclear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total area is the maximum of the areas of the selected functions. But that doesn\'t make sense. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial step of synthesizing a configuration to get actual area and latency values. For example, select sha256_transform_hls option 0 and sha256_update_hls option 0. Then, based on the result, adjust. \n\nBut the user\'s first step is to provide the first request. Since the options for sha256_transform_hls have similar areas and latencies, maybe choosing the one with the lowest area (option 0: 34,078.8) and for sha256_update_hls, the option with the lowest area that doesn\'t exceed the target when combined. But 34k + 42k is 76k, which is over. So perhaps the only way to get close to 40k is to select sha256_transform_hls option 0 (34k) and sha256_update_hls option 3 (41,743.1), but that\'s still over. Alternatively, maybe the target is per function, but that\'s not stated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area of the entire application is the sum of the areas of all the functions that are synthesized, but considering that some functions are included in others. For example, if sha256_update_hls includes sha256_transform_hls, then the total area would be the area of sha256_update_hls plus the area of any other functions not included in it. But this is unclear. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best first step is to synthesize a configuration to see what the total area and latency would be. For example, select sha256_transform_hls option 0 and sha256_update_hls option 0. The total area would be 34,078.8 + 42,191.2 = 76,270, which is over the target. But maybe the actual total area is different. Alternatively, maybe the area of sha256_update_hls already includes sha256_transform_hls, so the total area is just 42,191.2. But that\'s still over 40k. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the target is per function, but the problem states the total area. This is a bit of a dead end. \n\nAnother approach: the user mentioned that the functions\' options are for their HLS versions. The call graph shows that sha256_update calls sha256_transform, and sha256_final calls sha256_transform and others. So if we select an option for sha256_transform_hls, it affects all instances where it\'s called. Therefore, the total area would be the area of the top-level function (main) which includes all the called functions. But main\'s area isn\'t provided. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of all the functions that are synthesized with their options. For example, if we select sha256_transform_hls option 0 (34k) and sha256_update_hls option 0 (42k), the total area is 34k + 42k = 76k. But the target is 40k, so this is way over. Therefore, this suggests that the only way to get close to 40k is to select sha256_transform_hls option 0 (34k) and find a sha256_update_hls option with area around 6k, which doesn\'t exist. The available options for sha256_update_hls have much higher areas. \n\nThis indicates that perhaps the problem has a mistake, or I\'m misunderstanding the area reporting. Alternatively, maybe the area values are not additive, and the total area is determined by the largest function. But that doesn\'t make sense. \n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the best first step is to run a synthesis for a configuration to see what the actual total area and latency are. For example, select sha256_transform_hls option 0 and sha256_update_hls option 3 (area 41,743.1). The total area would be 34k + 41.7k = ~75.7k, which is over. But maybe the actual total area is different. Alternatively, maybe the area of sha256_update_hls already includes the sha256_transform_hls area. For example, if sha256_update_hls option 0 has area 42k, which includes the 34k of sha256_transform_hls, then the total area would be 42k. But then, if sha256_final_hls also calls sha256_transform_hls, does that add another 34k? That would make the total area 42k + (sha256_final_hls area + 34k). But we don\'t have data on sha256_final_hls. \n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial synthesis to gather data. So the first step would be to select sha256_transform_hls option 0 and sha256_update_hls option 0, then see the results. \n\nBut the user\'s options for sha256_update_hls include option 3 with area 41,743.1 and latency 84. Maybe that\'s the lowest area option for sha256_update_hls. But even that, when added to sha256_transform\'s 34k, would be over 75k. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area of sha256_update_hls is standalone, and the total area is just the sum of the two. But that\'s over the target. \n\nGiven that the target is 40k, and the lowest area for sha256_update_hls is around 42k, it\'s impossible to reach the target. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects us to select the sha256_transform_hls option with the lowest area and the sha256_update_hls option with the lowest area, even if it\'s over the target, and then see if there\'s a way to balance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the target is a per-function target, but the problem states it\'s the total area. \n\nGiven the confusion, the first step should be to synthesize a configuration to get actual data. So the first request would be to synthesize sha256_transform_hls option 0 and sha256_update_hls option 3 (the lowest area for sha256_update_hls). \n\nBut looking at the options again:\n\nsha256_update_hls options:\n0: area 42191.2, latency 84\n1: area 156387.1, latency 433\n2: area 42191.2, latency 84\n3: area 41743.1, latency 84\n4: area 105109.3, latency 5757\n\nSo option 3 for sha256_update_hls has the lowest area (41,743.1) and latency 84. So selecting that. For sha256_transform_hls, all options have similar areas, so option 0 (34,078.8). \n\nSo the total area would be 34,078.8 + 41,743.1 = 75,821.9, which is way over 40k. But maybe the actual total area is different. Perhaps the area of sha256_update_hls includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. For example, if sha256_update_hls option 3\'s area of 41,743.1 already includes the sha256_transform_hls area, then the total area would be 41,743.1. That\'s still over 40k, but closer. \n\nIf that\'s the case, then selecting sha256_update_hls option 3 would give an area of ~41.7k, which is close to 40k. Then, maybe there\'s a way to reduce the area further. But the options for sha256_transform_hls don\'t have lower areas. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area of sha256_transform_hls is included in sha256_update_hls. So if we select sha256_update_hls option 3, the total area is 41,743.1, and the sha256_transform_hls option doesn\'t affect the area because it\'s already included. But the problem statement says that selecting a different option for the child function affects the parent\'s outcome. So if we choose a different option for sha256_transform_hls, it would change the area of sha256_update_hls. But the given options for sha256_update_hls already include the child function\'s area. Therefore, the options for sha256_update_hls are synthesized with the best possible options for their children. \n\nThis suggests that the options for sha256_update_hls already include the optimal (for latency) options for sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, when we select an option for sha256_update_hls, the sha256_transform_hls option is fixed as part of that choice. But the problem statement says that we can choose options for both functions. This is conflicting. \n\nThe problem statement says: "Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function." So if we choose a different option for sha256_transform_hls, it will affect the parent function\'s (sha256_update_hls) area and latency. But the options provided for sha256_update_hls already have their own area and latency values. This suggests that the options for sha256_update_hls are synthesized with specific options for their child functions. Therefore, when we select an option for sha256_update_hls, it\'s already using a certain option for sha256_transform_hls. But the user provided separate options for both functions. This is confusing. \n\nGiven this, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a combinatorial optimization problem where each function\'s option contributes to the total area and latency, considering dependencies. But without knowing how the areas compose, it\'s hard to proceed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of all selected function options, and the latency is the sum of the latencies. But that\'s unlikely, as child functions are called multiple times. \n\nGiven the time I\'ve spent and the confusion, I think the best first step is to synthesize a configuration to get actual data. So I\'ll choose sha256_transform_hls option 0 and sha256_update_hls option 3, which have the lowest areas for their respective functions. The synthesis command would be:\n\nsynthesis: sha256_transform_hls 0, sha256_update_hls 3\n\nThis will give me the actual total area and latency, which can help clarify how the areas are combined.\n</think>\n\nsynthesis: sha256_transform_hls 0, sha256_update_hls 3', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=5857443794622998000)], created=1741050083, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5692, prompt_tokens=929, total_tokens=6621), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91ad743b0b348c3b', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 40,000. The last synthesis used sha256_transform_hls option 0 and sha256_update_hls option 3. The resulting area was 41,743.1, which is a bit over the target. The latency was 84.0.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available options again. For sha256_transform_hls, all options have similar areas around 34k, so maybe changing that won't help much. The main focus should be on sha256_update_hls. The options for sha256_update_hls are:\n\n0: area 42,191.2, latency 84\n1: area 156,387.1, latency 433 (too high area)\n2: same as 0\n3: area 41,743.1, latency 84\n4: area 105,109.3, latency 5757 (way too high latency)\n\nOption 3 for sha256_update_hls already gives the lowest area among the options with latency 84. But the total area is still over 40k. Maybe there's a way to reduce it further. Wait, the sha256_transform_hls options have area around 34k. If the total area from the last synthesis was 41k, that's probably just the sha256_update_hls area, since the parent functions include their children. Wait, the problem statement says that the area values reported for a function include the child functions. So when we select sha256_update_hls option 3, its area is 41,743.1, which already includes the sha256_transform_hls it calls. So the total area is just the area of sha256_update_hls plus any other top functions like main, but maybe main isn't synthesized. Hmm, the target is total area close to 40k, but the current area is 41k. So maybe we need to find a combination where the total area is lower.\n\nWait, the options for sha256_update_hls option 3 has area 41,743.1, which is already over 40k. The other options for sha256_update_hls with lower area are not present. The only lower area is option 3, which is 41k. The next option is 0 and 2, which are 42k. So maybe there's no way to get lower than 41k for sha256_update_hls. But the target is 40k. So perhaps the user is willing to accept a slightly higher area if latency is minimized. But the current latency is 84, which is the lowest possible for sha256_update_hls. The other options have higher latency. So maybe this is the best possible configuration. But the area is over the target. The user might want to see if there's a way to get closer to 40k. Alternatively, maybe combining different options for sha256_transform_hls could help. Let me check the options for sha256_transform_hls again.\n\nOptions for sha256_transform_hls:\n0: area 34078.8\n1: same as 0\n2: 34082.3\n3: same as 2\n4: same as 2\n\nSo all options for sha256_transform_hls have almost the same area, around 34k. Since sha256_update_hls includes sha256_transform, maybe using a different option for sha256_transform could affect the total area. But the difference between 34k and 34k is negligible. So changing sha256_transform's option won't help reduce the total area much. The main contributor is sha256_update_hls. Since the best option for sha256_update_hls in terms of area is option 3 (41,743.1), which is still over 40k, maybe the user has to accept that the closest possible is this configuration. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation. Wait, the target is 40k, and the current area is 41k. Maybe the user wants to see if there's a way to get closer. But looking at the options, there's no sha256_update_hls option with area lower than 41k. So perhaps this is the closest possible. Therefore, the best configuration is sha256_transform_hls 0 and sha256_update_hls 3, with latency 84 and area 41,743.1. Since the user wants to minimize latency while keeping area as close as possible to 40k, this might be the optimal solution. There's no better option with lower latency, and the area is the closest possible. So the next step is to accept this as the solution.\n</think>\n\nsolution: sha256_transform_hls 0, sha256_update_hls 3", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=481301139527159400)], created=1741050208, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=997, prompt_tokens=1107, total_tokens=2104), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.
