The synthesizable function names have an extras posfix _hls. Use this name to refer to the function in the optimization process indexing the options starting from 0.
The throughput is expressed in period, the lower the better.

The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions.
This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function.
Different options use different unrolling and pipelining factors. 

The goal is to minimize the latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 10500.

Provide your first request:

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91ad84d6bf7742aa', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, let\'s start by understanding the problem. The goal is to optimize the HLS configuration for the given application to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 10500. The functions involved have multiple options with different area, latency, and throughput values.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the call graph to see which functions are critical. The main function calls present80_encryptBlock, which in turn calls generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, and pLayer. generateRoundKeys80 further calls copyKey and copyBlock multiple times. So, the hierarchy is important here because the parent functions\' options will depend on their children\'s configurations.\n\nLooking at the options for each function:\n\n- copyKey_hls has options with areas ranging from ~529 to ~1527 and latencies from 1 to 19. The lower latency options (index 1,3) have much lower area and better latency. Since copyKey is called twice by generateRoundKeys80, using the low-latency options here could help reduce the overall latency of generateRoundKeys80.\n\n- copyBlock_hls has options with areas ~427 to ~1175 and latencies 1 to 15. Similarly, the lower latency options (index 2,4) are better for latency but have lower area. Since copyBlock is called twice in generateRoundKeys80, optimizing these could also help.\n\n- generateRoundKeys80_hls has all options with area around 2216-2241 and latency 882. The options don\'t vary much except the last one which has a slightly higher area but same latency. Maybe the child functions\' options affect this, but the parent\'s options here don\'t change much. So selecting the option with the lowest area (index 0-3) might be better.\n\n- addRoundKey_hls has options with area ~126 to ~424 and latency 0 or 14. The options with latency 0 (index 2,3) are very attractive for reducing latency. Their area is also much lower, which is great.\n\n- pLayer_hls has options with varying latencies from 15 to 150. The lowest latency is 15 (index 2,3), which also has a moderate area (~719). Choosing these would help reduce the latency in present80_encryptBlock.\n\n- present80_encryptBlock_hls has options with area ~12799 to ~13187 and latency 1978 to 2226. The last option (index 4) has a lower latency (1978) but higher area (13187.5). Since the target area is 10500, this might be too high. The other options have higher latency but lower area (~12821). However, the parent\'s area includes all child functions, so maybe selecting lower area options for the children can bring the total down.\n\nThe target area is 10500, but the present80_encryptBlock alone is around 12821 in its base options, which already exceeds the target. This suggests that the child functions\' areas are included in the parent\'s area. Wait, the problem statement says that the values reported for a function are obtained by synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. So when a parent function is synthesized, it includes the child functions\' areas. Therefore, the total area of the entire application would be the area of the top function (main), but main\'s options aren\'t provided. However, main calls present80_encryptBlock and printf. Since printf is likely a library function, the main area is probably dominated by present80_encryptBlock. So the total area is approximately the area of present80_encryptBlock plus any other functions not inlined. But according to the problem, the total area should be close to 10500. However, the present80_encryptBlock\'s options start at 12799, which is already higher than 10500. This suggests that maybe the child functions\' areas are part of the parent\'s area, and by selecting different options for the children, we can reduce the overall area.\n\nWait, the problem says that when a function is synthesized in isolation, the child functions are included. So the area reported for generateRoundKeys80_hls includes the areas of copyKey and copyBlock. Similarly, present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area includes generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc. Therefore, the total area of the application is the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) because it includes all the children. But the present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s options have areas around 12,800 to 13,187, which is way above the target of 10,500. This is a problem. How can we get the total area down to 10,500?\n\nWait, maybe the target is the sum of all individual function areas when synthesized in isolation. But that doesn\'t make sense because the parent functions include the children. Alternatively, perhaps the target is the sum of the areas of all functions when each is synthesized with their selected options, but without considering hierarchy. But that\'s unclear. The problem statement says: "the total area as close as possible to a target value". So perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of all functions in their selected configurations. But when a parent function is synthesized, it includes the child functions, so their areas are already part of the parent\'s area. Therefore, the total area would be the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) plus any functions not included in it, like main. But main\'s options aren\'t given, so maybe main is not synthesized and is part of the testbench. Therefore, the total area is just the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls. But its options are all around 12,800 to 13,187, which is way over 10,500. This suggests that the target is impossible unless there\'s a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the target is the sum of the areas of all the functions selected, but considering that when a parent function includes a child, the child\'s area is not added again. For example, if present80_encryptBlock includes generateRoundKeys80, then the area of generateRoundKeys80 is part of present80_encryptBlock\'s area. Therefore, the total area is the area of present80_encryptBlock. But that\'s still over 12k. So how can we reach 10,500? Maybe the target is a mistake, or perhaps I\'m misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the options for the functions are for their individual implementations, and when combined, the total area is the sum of all the functions\' areas. For example, if present80_encryptBlock uses generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, etc., each with their own options, then the total area is the sum of all these functions\' areas. But that contradicts the note that the parent\'s synthesis includes the child functions. So the parent\'s area already includes the child\'s area. Therefore, the total area is the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) because it includes all the children. But that\'s way over the target. So perhaps the target is a typo, or maybe there\'s a way to reduce the area by selecting lower-area options for the children, which would reduce the parent\'s area.\n\nWait, let\'s look at the options again. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls has an area of 2216.0 in option 0. But generateRoundKeys80 calls copyKey and copyBlock. If we select lower-area options for copyKey and copyBlock, would that reduce the area of generateRoundKeys80? The problem statement says that the values reported for a function are obtained by synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. So when generateRoundKeys80 is synthesized with option 0, it includes the best (lowest latency) options for copyKey and copyBlock. But if we manually select different options for copyKey and copyBlock, that would change the area and latency of generateRoundKeys80. Wait, no. The problem says that each function\'s options are different implementations (e.g., different unrolling or pipelining) and that the child functions are included. So the options for generateRoundKeys80_hls are different implementations that may use different options for the child functions. But the user provided the options for each function, including the child functions. So when you select an option for generateRoundKeys80_hls, it\'s already using certain options for its children (copyKey, copyBlock), but the user hasn\'t provided that information. Wait, the problem says: "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when generateRoundKeys80 is synthesized, it uses the best (lowest latency) options for copyKey and copyBlock. Therefore, the area reported for generateRoundKeys80 includes the area of copyKey and copyBlock with their best latency options. But in our optimization, we can choose different options for copyKey and copyBlock, which may have higher latency but lower area. However, that would affect the parent\'s latency. For example, if generateRoundKeys80 uses a slower copyKey (higher latency but lower area), then generateRoundKeys80\'s latency would increase, but the area might decrease. But the problem is that the options for generateRoundKeys80 are fixed, and their area and latency are already considering the best child options. So perhaps the options for the parent functions are fixed, and we can only choose the options for the leaf functions (like copyKey, copyBlock, addRoundKey, pLayer) and the top functions (generateRoundKeys80, present80_encryptBlock). Wait, the user provided options for all functions, including the parents. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls has 5 options, each with area 2216-2241 and latency 882. So regardless of the options chosen for copyKey and copyBlock, the generateRoundKeys80\'s options have fixed area and latency. That can\'t be right. There\'s a contradiction here. \n\nWait, the problem statement says: "Different options use different unrolling and pipelining factors." So each option for a function represents a different HLS directive (like pipeline, unroll) applied to that function. The child functions\' options are selected to minimize latency when the parent is synthesized. But when we choose an option for a child function, it affects the parent\'s area and latency. However, the user has provided the options for each function, including the parents, which already include the optimal child options. Therefore, if we choose a non-optimal child option (e.g., higher latency but lower area), the parent\'s latency would increase, but the area might decrease. However, the parent\'s options as given have fixed area and latency, which suggests that the parent\'s options are independent of the child\'s options. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options for each function are independent, and the total area is the sum of all selected function options. For example, if we select option 1 for copyKey_hls (area 529.7), option 2 for copyBlock_hls (area 427.6), etc., then the total area is the sum of all these selected options. But that would mean that functions called multiple times (like copyKey called twice in generateRoundKeys80) would have their area counted twice. But that\'s not how HLS works; each function is synthesized once, and its area is counted once, regardless of how many times it\'s called. So the total area would be the sum of the areas of all functions in their selected options. However, the problem states that the parent\'s area includes the child functions. So if generateRoundKeys80 is included in present80_encryptBlock, then generateRoundKeys80\'s area is part of present80_encryptBlock\'s area. Therefore, the total area would be the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls plus any functions not included in it, like main. But main\'s area isn\'t given, so perhaps it\'s negligible or part of the testbench. Therefore, the total area is just the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls. But its options are all over 12k, which is above the target of 10.5k. This suggests that the target is impossible unless there\'s a way to reduce the area by selecting different options for the child functions, thereby reducing the parent\'s area.\n\nWait, perhaps the options for the parent functions (like generateRoundKeys80_hls) are not fixed, but depend on the options selected for their children. For example, if we choose a lower-area option for copyKey_hls, then generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area would decrease. But the user has provided fixed options for generateRoundKeys80_hls, which suggests that those options already include certain child configurations. This is unclear. The problem statement says: "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when generateRoundKeys80 is synthesized, it uses the child functions\' best (lowest latency) options. Therefore, the area reported for generateRoundKeys80 includes the area of the child functions with their best latency options. But in our optimization, we can choose different options for the child functions (e.g., higher latency but lower area), which would affect the parent\'s area and latency. However, the parent\'s options as given have fixed area and latency, which suggests that those options are for different implementations of the parent function itself (like different pipelining) regardless of the child functions. This is conflicting.\n\nThis confusion makes it hard to proceed. Let\'s try to approach this step by step.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the latency of the entire application (which is determined by the present80_encryptBlock\'s latency) while keeping the total area close to 10500. The present80_encryptBlock\'s options have areas around 12.8k to 13.1k, which is higher than the target. So unless there\'s a way to reduce the area by selecting different child options, the target can\'t be met. Therefore, perhaps the child functions\' options can be chosen to reduce the area of the parent functions.\n\nFor example, generateRoundKeys80_hls has an area of 2216.0 in option 0. If we can choose lower-area options for copyKey and copyBlock, which are called by generateRoundKeys80, then the area of generateRoundKeys80 might decrease. However, according to the problem statement, the area reported for generateRoundKeys80 already includes the child functions\' areas when synthesized with their best latency options. So if we choose a different option for copyKey (e.g., option 1 with lower area but higher latency), then generateRoundKeys80\'s area would decrease, but its latency would increase. However, the generateRoundKeys80\'s options provided have fixed latency and area, which suggests that those are independent of the child options. This is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options for the parent functions are different implementations that may use different child options. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls option 0 might use copyKey option 0 and copyBlock option 0, while option 4 might use different child options. But the user hasn\'t provided that information, making it impossible to model.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed under the assumption that the total area is the sum of all selected function options, and the parent functions\' options do not include the child functions\' areas. But that contradicts the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of all functions in their selected options, considering that each function is synthesized once. For example, if present80_encryptBlock calls generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, etc., and each of those functions have their own options, then the total area is the sum of present80_encryptBlock\'s area plus generateRoundKeys80\'s area, etc. But that would lead to double-counting, as generateRoundKeys80 is part of present80_encryptBlock. This is not correct.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the initial step is to run a synthesis of a baseline configuration to see what the total area and latency are. For example, select the lowest latency options for all functions and see the area. Then adjust from there.\n\nThe present80_encryptBlock\'s lowest latency option is index 4 with latency 1978 and area 13187.5. But this is over the target area. The other options have higher latency but slightly lower area (12799.3 to 12821.8). Still, all are over 12k. So even the lowest area option for present80_encryptBlock is 12799.3, which is way above 10500. This suggests that the target area is impossible unless there\'s a way to reduce the area by selecting different child options.\n\nWait, perhaps the present80_encryptBlock\'s area is the sum of its own implementation plus the areas of its children. For example, if present80_encryptBlock is synthesized with option 0, which has area 12821.8, and that includes generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc., each with their own options. So if we can choose lower-area options for generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, and pLayer, then the total area of present80_encryptBlock would decrease.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the area of generateRoundKeys80 is 2216.0 (option 0), which includes its children. If we choose a lower-area option for generateRoundKeys80, that would help. But generateRoundKeys80\'s options are all around 2216-2241, so not much variation. Similarly, addRoundKey has options with area as low as 126.1 (index 2,3), which is much lower than the higher options. pLayer_hls has options as low as 719.4 (index 2,3). So if we select lower-area options for these child functions, the total area of present80_encryptBlock would decrease.\n\nBut how does the selection of child function options affect the parent\'s area and latency? For example, if generateRoundKeys80 is called by present80_encryptBlock, and we choose a lower-area option for generateRoundKeys80, then present80_encryptBlock\'s area would decrease by the difference in generateRoundKeys80\'s area. Similarly, the latency of present80_encryptBlock would depend on the latencies of its children.\n\nBut the problem states that the parent\'s latency is the sum of the latencies of its children plus its own. Or is it the critical path? For example, if generateRoundKeys80 has a latency of 882, and addRoundKey has 0, and pLayer has 15, then the total latency of present80_encryptBlock would be the sum of these plus its own overhead. But the present80_encryptBlock\'s options have latencies around 1978-2226, which likely includes the sum of its children\'s latencies.\n\nTherefore, to minimize the total latency, we need to minimize the sum of the latencies of all functions in the critical path. The critical path is from main to present80_encryptBlock, which calls generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc. generateRoundKeys80\'s latency is 882, which is a major contributor. If we can reduce that, it would help. But generateRoundKeys80\'s options all have the same latency of 882, except the last option which also has 882. So no help there. However, generateRoundKeys80\'s latency might depend on the latencies of copyKey and copyBlock. For example, if copyKey has a latency of 1 (option 1,3) and copyBlock has 1 (option 2,4), then generateRoundKeys80\'s latency might be lower. But according to the given data, generateRoundKeys80\'s latency is fixed at 882 regardless of the child options. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the latency of generateRoundKeys80 is fixed because it\'s determined by its own implementation, and the child latencies are part of that. For example, if generateRoundKeys80 calls copyKey twice and copyBlock twice, and each copyKey takes 1 cycle (option 1), and copyBlock takes 1 cycle (option 2), then the total latency for generateRoundKeys80 would be 2*1 + 2*1 = 4 cycles plus any overhead. But the reported latency for generateRoundKeys80 is 882, which is way higher. This suggests that the generateRoundKeys80\'s latency is dominated by its own processing, not the children. Therefore, the child functions\' latencies are negligible compared to the parent\'s. But that contradicts the data, as copyKey\'s latency can be 19 cycles, which would add up if called multiple times.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Perhaps the best approach is to start by synthesizing a configuration with the lowest latency options for all functions to see the total area and latency. Then adjust from there to reduce the area towards the target.\n\nThe lowest latency options would be:\n\n- copyKey_hls: option 1 or 3 (latency 1, area 529.7)\n- copyBlock_hls: option 2 or 4 (latency 1, area 427.6)\n- generateRoundKeys80_hls: any option (latency 882, area ~2216)\n- addRoundKey_hls: option 2 or 3 (latency 0, area 126.1)\n- pLayer_hls: option 2 or 3 (latency 15, area 719.4)\n- present80_encryptBlock_hls: option 4 (latency 1978, area 13187.5)\n\nBut the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 is 13187.5, which is way over the target. However, if the child functions\' areas are part of the parent\'s area, then selecting lower-area options for the children might reduce the parent\'s area. For example, if generateRoundKeys80\'s area is 2216, but we choose lower-area options for copyKey and copyBlock, maybe generateRoundKeys80\'s area would decrease, thus reducing present80_encryptBlock\'s area.\n\nBut according to the given data, generateRoundKeys80\'s options have fixed area regardless of the child options. This suggests that the child options are fixed when the parent is synthesized. Therefore, the user\'s provided options for each function already include the optimal child options for latency. Therefore, to reduce the area, we need to choose higher-latency but lower-area options for the child functions, which would increase the parent\'s latency but decrease the total area.\n\nFor example, if we choose copyKey_hls option 1 (area 529.7, latency 1) instead of option 0 (area 1527.9, latency 19), but wait, option 1 has lower area and lower latency. That\'s better in both aspects. So why would anyone choose option 0? Maybe there\'s a mistake in the data. Looking back:\n\nOptions for copyKey_hls:\n- Option 0: area 1527.9, latency 19.0\n- Option 1: area 529.7, latency 1.0\n- Option 2: same as 0\n- Option 3: same as 1\n- Option 4: same as 0\n\nSo options 0,2,4 are high area and high latency; options 1,3 are low area and low latency. So obviously, choosing options 1 or 3 for copyKey_hls is better in both aspects. Similarly for copyBlock_hls, options 2 and 4 are better (lower area and latency). So why are there multiple options with the same values? Maybe they represent different HLS directives, but in this case, the best options are clear.\n\nTherefore, for copyKey_hls and copyBlock_hls, the best options are the ones with latency 1 and lower area. For addRoundKey_hls, options 2 and 3 have latency 0 and area 126.1, which is better. For pLayer_hls, options 2 and 3 have latency 15 and area 719.4. For generateRoundKeys80_hls, all options have the same latency 882, so choose the one with the lowest area (option 0-3, area 2216.0). For present80_encryptBlock_hls, option 4 has the lowest latency (1978) but highest area (13187.5). The other options have higher latency but slightly lower area.\n\nIf we select the best options for all child functions, the total area would be the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 (13187.5) plus the areas of the other functions? No, because present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area already includes the child functions. So the total area is 13187.5, which is way over the target. Therefore, we need to find a way to reduce the area by selecting higher-latency but lower-area options for some functions.\n\nFor example, if we choose a higher-latency option for generateRoundKeys80_hls that has a lower area. But all generateRoundKeys80_hls options have area around 2216, except option 4 which is 2241.9. So no help there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls can be reduced by selecting lower-area options for its child functions. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area is 2216, but if we can reduce that by selecting different options for copyKey and copyBlock, which are part of generateRoundKeys80. But according to the problem statement, generateRoundKeys80\'s area already includes the best child options. So if we choose a different option for copyKey, which has lower area but higher latency, then generateRoundKeys80\'s area would decrease, but its latency would increase. However, the generateRoundKeys80\'s options provided have fixed area and latency, which suggests that those are independent of the child options. This is conflicting.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to run a synthesis of the configuration with the lowest latency options for all functions to get a baseline. Then, if the area is too high, start replacing some child function options with higher-latency but lower-area ones to reduce the total area.\n\nBut according to the data, the lowest latency options for the child functions (copyKey, copyBlock, addRoundKey, pLayer) also have the lowest area. So there\'s no trade-off there. For example, copyKey\'s option 1 has lower area and lower latency than option 0. So there\'s no need to choose a higher-latency option for area reduction in these functions. The only trade-off is in present80_encryptBlock_hls: option 4 has lower latency but higher area, while the others have higher latency but slightly lower area.\n\nWait, present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 has area 13187.5 and latency 1978, while option 0 has area 12821.8 and latency 2226. So option 4 is better in latency but worse in area. The target area is 10500, which is much lower than 12821.8. So even the lowest area option for present80_encryptBlock_hls is over the target. This suggests that the target cannot be met, and the best we can do is get as close as possible.\n\nBut how? The only way to reduce the area further is to select lower-area options for the child functions, but they already have the lowest area options. Unless there\'s a mistake in the data.\n\nWait, looking at generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s options: all have area around 2216 except option 4 (2241.9). So selecting option 0-3 for generateRoundKeys80_hls gives lower area. Similarly, addRoundKey_hls\'s options 2 and 3 have area 126.1, which is lower than other options. pLayer_hls\'s options 2 and 3 have area 719.4, which is lower than other options. copyKey and copyBlock already have their lowest area options selected.\n\nSo the total area of present80_encryptBlock_hls would be its own area plus the areas of its children. Wait, no. The present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area already includes the areas of generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc. Because when you synthesize a function, it includes the child functions. Therefore, the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls is the sum of its own logic plus the areas of all the child functions it calls. But according to the data, present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area is around 12.8k to 13.1k. If we can reduce the areas of the child functions, that would reduce the parent\'s area.\n\nBut the child functions\' lowest area options are already selected. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s lowest area is 2216.0 (option 0-3), addRoundKey_hls\'s lowest is 126.1 (options 2,3), pLayer_hls\'s lowest is 719.4 (options 2,3), copyKey_hls\'s lowest is 529.7 (options 1,3), copyBlock_hls\'s lowest is 427.6 (options 2,4). \n\nAssuming that present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area is the sum of its own logic plus the areas of generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc., then:\n\npresent80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area = its own area + generateRoundKeys80\'s area + addRoundKey\'s area + pLayer\'s area + ... \n\nBut according to the data, present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area is around 12.8k, which is much larger than the sum of the child areas. For example, generateRoundKeys80 (2216) + addRoundKey (126) + pLayer (719) + copyKey (529) + copyBlock (427) = 2216 + 126 + 719 + 529 + 427 = 4017. So the present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s own logic must be around 12.8k - 4k = 8.8k. This suggests that the majority of the area is in the present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s own implementation, not the children. Therefore, to reduce the total area, we need to focus on present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s options.\n\nThe present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s option 4 has the highest area (13187.5) but lowest latency (1978). The other options have lower area (12799.3 to 12821.8) but higher latency (2226). The target area is 10500, which is much lower than even the lowest present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area. This suggests that the target is impossible to meet, and the best we can do is get as close as possible. Therefore, the closest area would be the lowest present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area, which is 12799.3 (option 2 or 3). But that\'s still over 12k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the target area is a typo and should be higher, like 15000. But given the problem statement, we have to proceed with 10500.\n\nGiven this, perhaps the best approach is to select the lowest area options for all functions, even if it means higher latency, to get as close as possible to 10500. But the lowest area options for the child functions are already selected, and the present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s lowest area is 12799.3. So that\'s still over. Therefore, the problem might require accepting that the target is unattainable and finding the configuration with the lowest latency that has the closest area to 10500, even if it\'s over.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there\'s a misunderstanding in how the area is calculated. Maybe the total area is the sum of all individual function areas, not including hierarchy. For example, if present80_encryptBlock_hls is synthesized with option 0 (area 12821.8), and generateRoundKeys80_hls is synthesized with option 0 (area 2216.0), and so on, then the total area would be 12821.8 + 2216.0 + ... which would be much higher. But that\'s unlikely.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the first step is to synthesize a configuration with the lowest latency options to see the area and then adjust. The initial synthesis would be:\n\nsynthesis: copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 4\n\nThis selects the lowest latency options for all child functions and the lowest latency option for present80_encryptBlock. The area would be 13187.5, which is over the target. Then, to reduce the area, we might need to choose a higher-latency option for present80_encryptBlock_hls (e.g., option 2 with area 12799.3) and see if that brings the area closer. But even 12799 is still over 10500.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the child functions\' areas can be reduced further by selecting higher-latency options. For example, if we choose a higher-latency option for generateRoundKeys80_hls, but the options for generateRoundKeys80_hls all have similar areas. Or perhaps choosing a higher-latency option for pLayer_hls, which has higher area options. For example, pLayer_hls option 0 has area 1007.7 and latency 150. If we choose that, the area would increase, which is worse. So that\'s not helpful.\n\nThis seems like a dead end. The only way to reduce the area is to choose a lower-area option for present80_encryptBlock_hls, but its options are all over 12k. Therefore, the target cannot be met, and the best solution is to choose the configuration with the lowest latency (present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4) and accept the area of 13187.5. However, the problem states to keep the area as close as possible to 10500. So perhaps the closest is the lowest area option for present80_encryptBlock_hls, which is 12799.3 (option 2 or 3), which is 12799.3 - 10500 = 2299.3 over. Alternatively, maybe there\'s a combination where some child functions are not optimized for latency, thus reducing the parent\'s area.\n\nFor example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls is synthesized with a lower-area option, but according to the data, all its options have similar areas. Or if addRoundKey_hls is synthesized with a higher-latency but lower-area option, but its lowest area is already selected.\n\nThis is very challenging. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to run a synthesis of the lowest latency configuration and then see the area, then adjust. Therefore, the first step is to request a synthesis of the configuration with the lowest latency options for all functions.\n</think>\n\nsynthesis: copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 4', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=9496944307024316000)], created=1741050888, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7559, prompt_tokens=1583, total_tokens=9142), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91ad8792ec9542cb', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, let\'s see. The user\'s goal is to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 10500. The last synthesis run resulted in a total area of 13187.5, which is way over the target. The latency was 1978. So, I need to find a configuration that reduces the area significantly without increasing latency too much.\n\nFirst, let\'s look at the functions contributing to the area. The present80_encryptBlock_hls has the highest area, and in the last run, option 4 was used with area 13187.5. Maybe there\'s a lower area option for this function. Looking at its options, option 0 has area 12821.8, option 2 is 12799.3. So switching to option 2 might save some area. But the latency for option 4 was 1978, which is better than the others (2226). So there\'s a trade-off here. If we switch back to a higher latency option for present80_encryptBlock_hls, the area might decrease but latency increases. But since the user wants to minimize latency, maybe we should keep option 4 for present80_encryptBlock_hls but look for savings elsewhere.\n\nLooking at generateRoundKeys80_hls, all options except the last one have area 2216.0, and the last is 2241.9. The last run used option 0 (area 2216). So that\'s already the lowest for that function. Maybe no savings there.\n\nNext, copyKey_hls was using option 1 (area 529.7). The other options for copyKey_hls are higher (1527.9), so keeping option 1 is good for area.\n\ncopyBlock_hls was using option 2 (area 427.6). That\'s the lowest possible, so no change there.\n\naddRoundKey_hls was using option 2 (area 126.1), which is the lowest. Good.\n\npLayer_hls was using option 2 (area 719.4). The options for pLayer_hls: option 0 is 1007.7, option 1 is 902.8, option 2 is 719.4, option 3 same as 2, option 4 is 867.7. So option 2 is the lowest area. So that\'s already optimized.\n\nSo the main area contributors are present80_encryptBlock_hls (13187.5) and generateRoundKeys80_hls (2216.0). Together, they sum to around 15403.5, which is way over the target. Wait, but the total area reported was 13187.5. Maybe the generateRoundKeys80_hls is included in the present80_encryptBlock_hls synthesis? Because generateRoundKeys80 is a child function of present80_encryptBlock. So when synthesizing present80_encryptBlock, the child functions\' areas are included. So the total area of present80_encryptBlock_hls already includes the areas of its children. Therefore, the total area is just the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls plus any other top-level functions. But in the call graph, main calls present80_encryptBlock and printf. So the total area is the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls plus any other functions not included in it. Wait, but when you synthesize a parent function, the child functions are part of the synthesis. So the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls includes all its children. So the total area is the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls plus main and printf. But main is probably not synthesized, so the total area is just present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area. Wait, the user mentioned that the values reported for a function are obtained by synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. So when you choose options for child functions, the parent function\'s area and latency are computed based on those choices. Therefore, the total area is the sum of all the functions\' areas? Or is it the area of the top function, which includes all the children? This is a bit confusing.\n\nThe user said: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when you synthesize generateRoundKeys80_hls, it includes its children (copyKey, copyBlock, etc.), and the area reported for generateRoundKeys80_hls includes those. But when you synthesize present80_encryptBlock_hls, which calls generateRoundKeys80_hls, the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls includes generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area. So the total area of the design is the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) plus any other functions not included in it, like main and printf. But main is probably not synthesized, so the total area is just present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area. Wait, but in the last synthesis report, the total area was 13187.5, which matches the present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4\'s area (13187.5). So that makes sense. Therefore, the total area is determined by the option chosen for present80_encryptBlock_hls, which in turn depends on the options chosen for its child functions. So to reduce the total area, we need to choose options for the child functions that, when combined, result in a lower area for present80_encryptBlock_hls.\n\nBut how do the child function options affect the parent\'s area? For example, if we choose a lower area option for generateRoundKeys80_hls, that would reduce the area of generateRoundKeys80_hls, which is part of present80_encryptBlock_hls. But looking at generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s options, all have area around 2216 except the last one (2241.9). So choosing option 0 for generateRoundKeys80_hls (area 2216) is better. But in the last run, generateRoundKeys80_hls was already using option 0. So that\'s already optimized.\n\nWait, but the present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area is 13187.5 in option 4. The other options for present80_encryptBlock_hls have areas like 12821.8, 12799.3, etc. So maybe switching to option 2 (12799.3) would reduce the area. But what\'s the latency of that option? The present80_encryptBlock_hls options 0-3 have latency 2226, while option 4 has 1978. So if we switch to option 2, the area would be 12799.3, which is still over the target of 10500, but lower than 13187.5. However, the latency would increase from 1978 to 2226. That\'s a trade-off. The user wants to minimize latency, so maybe that\'s not desirable. But the area is way over target. So perhaps we need to find a balance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the child functions can be optimized further. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls has options with area 2216.0. If we can reduce that, but looking at its options, all have similar areas except the last one. So no help there.\n\nLooking at pLayer_hls: option 2 has area 719.4. If there\'s a lower area option, but it seems that\'s the lowest. Similarly for addRoundKey_hls, copyKey_hls, and copyBlock_hls, the options chosen are already the lowest area.\n\nWait, but maybe the parent function\'s area is a sum of its own logic plus the areas of the child functions. So if we can reduce the areas of the child functions, that would reduce the parent\'s area. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area is 2216.0. If we can choose a lower area option for its children (copyKey and copyBlock), which are already at their lowest (copyKey_hls option 1: 529.7, copyBlock_hls option 2: 427.6). So those are already minimized. So generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area can\'t be reduced further.\n\nTherefore, the main way to reduce the total area is to choose a lower area option for present80_encryptBlock_hls, even if it increases latency. But the user wants to minimize latency. So perhaps a balance is needed. Let\'s see: the target area is 10500, and the current area is 13187.5. We need to reduce by about 2687.5. The present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s option 2 has area 12799.3, which is still 12799.3 - 10500 = 2299.3 over. Still too high. Option 0 is 12821.8, which is even worse. So even the lowest area option for present80_encryptBlock_hls is 12799.3, which is way over the target. Hmm, this suggests that the target area of 10500 might not be achievable with the current function options. But maybe there\'s a way to combine different options for child functions to reduce the parent\'s area.\n\nWait, perhaps the present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area is influenced by the options of its child functions. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls uses a lower area option, that would reduce the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls. But generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s options are all around 2216 except the last one. So maybe using generateRoundKeys80_hls option 4 (area 2241.9) would increase the area, which is worse. So no help there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the child functions like addRoundKey_hls, pLayer_hls, etc., when using lower area options, contribute to a lower area in present80_encryptBlock_hls. For example, in the last run, addRoundKey_hls was using option 2 (area 126.1), which is the lowest. pLayer_hls option 2 (719.4). So those are already minimized. So the only way to reduce the parent\'s area is to choose a different option for present80_encryptBlock_hls itself, but all its options are over 12k. So perhaps the target is unrealistic, but the user wants to get as close as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the total area is the sum of all the functions\' individual areas. For example, present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area is 13187.5, but that includes all its children. So the total area is just 13187.5. But the target is 10500, which is much lower. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the target, or there\'s a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the functions can be optimized in a way that their combined area is lower. But given the options provided, it\'s unclear.\n\nAnother approach: use the Python script with OR-Tools to model this as an optimization problem. The variables are the options for each function, and the objective is to minimize latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 10500. But how to model the dependencies? For example, the area of generateRoundKeys80_hls includes its children, so if we select options for copyKey and copyBlock, that affects generateRoundKeys80\'s area, which in turn affects present80_encryptBlock\'s area. This is a hierarchical problem. However, the user mentioned that when synthesizing a function in isolation, the child functions\' best options are selected. Wait, no: the user said, "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when a function is synthesized, it uses the best latency options for its children, which might not be the same as the options chosen for the children when synthesized in isolation. Wait, this is confusing. Let me re-read the user\'s instruction.\n\n"The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function."\n\nAh, so when you synthesize a parent function, it uses the child functions\' options that give the best latency for the parent. But when you explicitly select an option for a child function, that overrides the automatic selection. So if we choose specific options for child functions, the parent\'s synthesis will use those, which might not be the best latency but could lead to a lower area.\n\nSo the total area is the sum of the areas of all the functions with their selected options. But when a parent function is synthesized, it includes the child functions, so their areas are part of the parent\'s area. Wait, no. For example, if present80_encryptBlock_hls is synthesized with generateRoundKeys80_hls option 0, then the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls includes generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area. But if generateRoundKeys80_hls is also synthesized with its own options, that would be double-counting. So perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of all the functions that are synthesized, but considering that child functions are part of the parent\'s synthesis. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each function\'s area is standalone, and when a parent function calls a child, the child\'s area is added to the parent\'s. But that\'s not how HLS works. In HLS, when you synthesize a top function, it includes all the called functions, and their implementations are part of the top function\'s hardware. So the area of the top function includes all the child functions. Therefore, the total area is just the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) plus any other top-level functions (like main, which is probably not synthesized). Therefore, the total area is the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls, which in turn depends on the options selected for its child functions.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user says that each function\'s options have their own area and latency. So when you select an option for a child function, that affects the parent\'s area and latency. Therefore, the total area is the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) when synthesized with the selected options for its children. So the challenge is to choose options for all functions such that the top function\'s area is as close as possible to 10500, with minimal latency.\n\nGiven that, the previous synthesis used present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4, which has area 13187.5. To reduce the area, we need to choose options for the child functions that, when combined, result in a lower area for present80_encryptBlock_hls. But how do the child function options affect the parent\'s area? For example, if we choose a lower area option for generateRoundKeys80_hls, that would reduce the area contribution of generateRoundKeys80_hls within present80_encryptBlock_hls, thus reducing the total area. But generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s options are mostly the same except option 4. Let\'s check:\n\ngenerateRoundKeys80_hls options:\n- 0: area 2216.0\n- 4: area 2241.9\n\nSo option 4 is worse. So no gain there.\n\nSimilarly, for other child functions like addRoundKey_hls, using option 2 (area 126.1) is the lowest. pLayer_hls option 2 (719.4) is the lowest. copyKey_hls option 1 (529.7) is the lowest. copyBlock_hls option 2 (427.6) is the lowest.\n\nSo all child functions are already at their minimal area options. Therefore, the only way to reduce the top function\'s area is to choose a different option for present80_encryptBlock_hls itself. Looking at its options:\n\npresent80_encryptBlock_hls options:\n- 0: area 12821.8, latency 2226\n- 1: same as 0\n- 2: 12799.3, latency 2226\n- 3: same as 2\n- 4: 13187.5, latency 1978\n\nSo option 2 has the lowest area (12799.3) but higher latency (2226). Option 4 has higher area but lower latency. The target area is 10500, which is much lower than 12799.3. So even the lowest area option for the top function is still over the target. This suggests that the target may not be achievable with the current function options. However, the user wants to get as close as possible.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the best approach is to accept that the area can\'t reach 10500 and find the configuration with the lowest latency that has the closest area to 10500. But the previous run had area 13187.5, which is 2687.5 over. The next closest is 12799.3, which is 2299.3 over. Still far. Alternatively, maybe there\'s a combination where some child functions use higher area options but allow the parent to use a lower area option. But that seems counterintuitive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the target area, or there\'s a misunderstanding. But given the information, I need to proceed.\n\nAnother angle: the present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area is influenced by the options of its child functions. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls uses a lower area option, that could reduce the parent\'s area. But generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s options are fixed. So perhaps the only way is to use present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s option 2 (area 12799.3) and see if that\'s closer. But even that is still over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended the target area to be the sum of all individual function areas. For example, if each function\'s area is considered separately, then the total area would be the sum of all functions\' areas. Let\'s calculate that:\n\nIn the last run, the selected options were:\n\ncopyKey_hls 1 (529.7)\ncopyBlock_hls 2 (427.6)\ngenerateRoundKeys80_hls 0 (2216.0)\naddRoundKey_hls 2 (126.1)\npLayer_hls 2 (719.4)\npresent80_encryptBlock_hls 4 (13187.5)\n\nIf the total area is the sum of all these, it would be 529.7 + 427.6 + 2216.0 + 126.1 + 719.4 + 13187.5 = 17206.3. But the synthesis report said the total area was 13187.5, which matches the present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area. So that suggests that the total area is just the top function\'s area, which includes all children. Therefore, the other functions\' areas are part of the top function\'s area. So changing child function options affects the top function\'s area.\n\nTherefore, to reduce the top function\'s area, we need to choose options for the child functions that, when synthesized into the top function, result in a lower area. But how do the child function options affect the top function\'s area? For example, if a child function uses a lower area option, the top function\'s area would decrease by the difference between the child\'s previous area and the new area. But this depends on how the HLS tool incorporates the child functions.\n\nAssuming that each child function\'s area is additive within the parent, then selecting lower area options for children would reduce the parent\'s area. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area is 2216.0, and we can reduce it, that would help. But its options are fixed. Similarly for other functions.\n\nBut in the last run, all child functions were already using their lowest area options. Therefore, the only way to reduce the top function\'s area is to choose a different option for the top function itself. But all its options are over 12k. So perhaps the target is unattainable, and the best we can do is minimize latency while getting as close as possible to 10500.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a combination where some child functions use higher area options but allow the top function to use a lower area option. For example, if using a different option for generateRoundKeys80_hls allows the top function to have a lower area. But generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s options don\'t vary much in area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area is influenced by the pipelining and unrolling factors chosen in its own options. For example, option 4 has a lower latency (1978) but higher area (13187.5) compared to option 2 (12799.3, 2226 latency). So there\'s a trade-off between latency and area. To get closer to the target area, we might need to choose a higher latency option with lower area. For example, present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 has area 12799.3, which is still over, but closer than 13187.5. The latency would increase from 1978 to 2226. That\'s a 248 increase in latency for a 388.2 reduction in area. Whether that\'s worth it depends on the user\'s priorities. Since the user wants to minimize latency while keeping area close to 10500, perhaps the best approach is to try different present80_encryptBlock_hls options and see which gives the best trade-off.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the child functions\' options can be adjusted to allow the top function to have a lower area. For example, if a child function uses a higher area option that allows the top function to be optimized better. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, run a Python script using OR-Tools to model this as an optimization problem. The variables are the options for each function, and the objective is to minimize latency, subject to the area being as close as possible to 10500. However, the area of the top function depends on the options of its children. But how to model that? The area of present80_encryptBlock_hls is determined by its own option and the options of its children. But the options for the children affect their areas, which in turn affect the parent\'s area. This is a hierarchical dependency.\n\nBut given the information provided, each function\'s area is fixed based on its option. The parent\'s area is not a simple sum but is determined when synthesized with the selected child options. However, the user provided the area of each function when synthesized in isolation with the best child options. But when we select specific child options, the parent\'s area may change. But the user hasn\'t provided data on how the parent\'s area changes with different child options. Therefore, it\'s impossible to model this accurately without more data.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to try different combinations of child function options and synthesize to see the resulting area and latency. For example, try using present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 (lower area) with the same child options. But in the last run, the child options were already minimal. So the area would be 12799.3, latency 2226. That\'s better in area but worse in latency. Alternatively, try present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 with some child functions using higher area options that might allow the parent to have lower area. But this is a shot in the dark.\n\nAlternatively, the user might need to accept that the target area is too low and choose the configuration with the lowest latency that has the closest area. In that case, the previous run\'s configuration (latency 1978, area 13187.5) might be the best, but the area is way over. Alternatively, the configuration with present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 (area 12799.3, latency 2226) is closer to the target but higher latency.\n\nAnother angle: the target area is 10500, and the closest we can get is 12799.3, which is 2299.3 over. Maybe there\'s a way to reduce the area further by adjusting other functions. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls can be optimized by using different child options. But generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s children are copyKey and copyBlock, which are already at their lowest area options. So no gain there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area can be reduced by using different options for addRoundKey_hls or pLayer_hls. For example, if addRoundKey_hls uses a higher area option that allows the parent to have lower area. But this is counterintuitive. For example, if addRoundKey_hls uses option 0 (area 424.1) instead of option 2 (126.1), would that affect the parent\'s area? It might increase the parent\'s area, which is not desirable.\n\nGiven all this, perhaps the best next step is to synthesize the configuration with present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 and the same child options to see if the area decreases as expected. So the configuration would be:\n\ncopyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 2.\n\nThis should give an area of 12799.3 and latency 2226. Then compare the area difference to the target and see if it\'s better than the previous run. Even though the latency is higher, the area is closer to the target. The user wants to minimize latency while keeping area as close as possible. So perhaps this is a better trade-off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a combination where some child functions use higher area options but allow the parent to use a lower area option. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls uses a different option that somehow reduces the parent\'s area. But without data on how child options affect the parent\'s area, it\'s hard to predict.\n\nAnother approach: use the Python script to model the problem, assuming that the total area is the sum of all individual function areas. But this is likely incorrect, as the parent\'s area includes the children. However, for the sake of exploration, let\'s try that.\n\nThe total area would be the sum of all selected function options\' areas. The target is 10500. The objective is to minimize latency (sum of all function latencies) while keeping the total area as close as possible to 10500.\n\nBut this is a simplification. The actual area is the top function\'s area, which includes the children. But given the lack of data, this might be the only way.\n\nThe functions involved are:\n\n- copyKey_hls\n- copyBlock_hls\n- generateRoundKeys80_hls\n- addRoundKey_hls\n- pLayer_hls\n- present80_encryptBlock_hls\n\nAssuming that the total area is the sum of all these functions\' areas (even though in reality, the top function includes them), the problem becomes a knapsack-like optimization: select options for each function to minimize total latency, with the total area as close as possible to 10500.\n\nBut this is a flawed model. However, given the information, it\'s a starting point.\n\nThe Python script would need to:\n\n1. Define variables for each function\'s option.\n2. Calculate the total area and total latency.\n3. Minimize the latency while keeping the area as close as possible to 10500.\n\nBut since the area is a soft constraint (as close as possible), the objective could be a weighted sum of latency and the absolute difference between area and 10500.\n\nAlternatively, find the configuration with the minimum latency where the area is <= 10500 + tolerance. But given that the lowest possible area is around 12799, this is impossible. So instead, minimize the absolute difference.\n\nBut without knowing how the functions\' areas combine, this approach is speculative. However, it\'s worth trying to see if it suggests any configurations.\n\nThe script would need to iterate through all possible combinations, which is computationally expensive, but with OR-Tools, perhaps a constraint programming approach can be used.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the best next step is to run such a script to find the optimal combination under the assumption that the total area is the sum of individual areas.\n\nBut the user\'s actual total area is the top function\'s area, which is present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area. So the script should consider that the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls is determined by its own option and the options of its children. But without knowing how the child options affect the parent\'s area, this is impossible to model accurately.\n\nTherefore, the practical approach is to try different configurations of the top function and its children, synthesizing each time to get the actual area and latency. Given that, the next step could be to try the present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 with the same child options to see if the area decreases to 12799.3, which is closer to the target.\n</think>\n\nsynthesis: copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 2', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=9774364126872576000)], created=1741051000, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6270, prompt_tokens=1800, total_tokens=8070), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91ad89ff1c2119cb', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, let\'s see. The user is trying to optimize a C application using HLS. The goal is to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 10500. The current configuration they tried has an area of 12799.3 and latency of 2226. That\'s way over the target area.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the functions involved. The main functions are copyKey_hls, copyBlock_hls, generateRoundKeys80_hls, addRoundKey_hls, pLayer_hls, and present80_encryptBlock_hls. Each has several options with different area and latency trade-offs.\n\nThe last synthesis used present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2, which has an area of 12799.3. The target is 10500, so we need to reduce area by about 2300. Let\'s check the options for present80_encryptBlock_hls. The options 0-4 have areas ranging from 12799.3 to 13187.5. Wait, all options for present80_encryptBlock_hls are over 12k. That\'s a problem because even the lowest is 12799.3, which is still way above 10500. So maybe the parent function\'s area is too high, and we need to look at its child functions.\n\nLooking at the call graph, present80_encryptBlock calls generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc. generateRoundKeys80 has options with area 2216.0 to 2241.9. But generateRoundKeys80 itself calls copyKey and copyBlock multiple times. So maybe optimizing those child functions can reduce the overall area.\n\nFor example, copyKey_hls has options with areas 529.7 and 1527.9. Using the lower area option (index 1) for copyKey_hls would help. Similarly, copyBlock_hls has options with 427.6 (index 2 and 4). The current config uses copyBlock_hls 2, which is already the low area option. So maybe those are already optimized.\n\nLooking at generateRoundKeys80_hls, all options have area around 2216.0. Not much variation there. Maybe there\'s no way to reduce that. Then addRoundKey_hls has options with area as low as 126.1 (index 2 and 3). The current config uses addRoundKey_hls 2, which is the low area option. pLayer_hls has options with area from 719.4 to 1007.7. The current config uses pLayer_hls 2, which is 719.4, the lowest area. So those are already optimized.\n\nSo the main issue is present80_encryptBlock_hls itself. Its options are all over 12k. But the target is 10.5k. That\'s a big gap. Maybe the child functions\' areas are included in the parent\'s area. So if we can reduce the area of the child functions, the parent\'s area might decrease. But the child functions are already using the lowest area options. Wait, generateRoundKeys80_hls has area 2216.0, which is part of present80_encryptBlock\'s area. If generateRoundKeys80 is called multiple times, maybe optimizing it further could help. But its options don\'t have lower area. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the target area. But assuming the target is correct, perhaps the only way is to find a combination where the sum of all functions\' areas is close to 10.5k. Let\'s calculate the current total area. The present80_encryptBlock_hls area is 12799.3, which includes its children. But if each child\'s area is part of the parent\'s, then the total area is just the present80_encryptBlock_hls area. Because when you synthesize a parent function, it includes the child functions. So the total area reported is for the top function, which is present80_encryptBlock_hls. So the target is 10.5k, but the current options for present80_encryptBlock_hls are all around 12.8k to 13.1k. That\'s a problem. There\'s no option for present80_encryptBlock_hls that\'s close to 10.5k. Unless there\'s a mistake in the options provided.\n\nWait, looking back, the options for present80_encryptBlock_hls are:\n\nOption 0: 12821.8\n\nOption 1: 12821.8\n\nOption 2: 12799.3\n\nOption 3: 12799.3\n\nOption 4: 13187.5\n\nSo all are over 12k. The target is 10.5k. That\'s impossible with the given options. Unless the user meant the sum of all individual functions, but that\'s not how HLS works. The top function\'s area includes all called functions. So maybe the target is unrealistic, or there\'s a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to select options for the child functions that are part of the top function\'s synthesis, thereby affecting the total area.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when you synthesize a parent function, it uses the best (lowest latency) options for the child functions. But when we select options for the child functions, that might override the default selection. So the total area of the top function depends on the options chosen for the child functions. Therefore, by selecting different options for the child functions (even if they have higher latency but lower area), we can reduce the total area of the top function.\n\nAh, that\'s the key point. The initial synthesis of generateRoundKeys80_hls in isolation uses the best latency options for its children (copyKey and copyBlock). But if we force generateRoundKeys80_hls to use lower area options for its children (even if that increases latency), the total area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) might decrease.\n\nSo the strategy is to select options for the child functions that have lower area, even if their latency is higher, which might allow the parent function\'s area to decrease. However, the user\'s goal is to minimize latency, so there\'s a trade-off.\n\nBut the user wants to minimize latency while keeping the area close to 10.5k. So perhaps we need to find a balance where the child functions are using lower area options, thus reducing the total area of the top function, even if that increases the latency of the child functions. But since the parent function\'s latency is the sum (or some function) of the child latencies, this might increase the total latency. However, the user is willing to accept some increase in latency if it brings the area closer to the target.\n\nWait, but the user\'s primary goal is to minimize latency, with area as close as possible to 10.5k. So we need to find the configuration with the lowest possible latency where the area is as close as possible to 10.5k.\n\nGiven that the current configurations are giving areas around 12.8k, which is 2.3k over the target, we need to find a way to reduce the area. Let\'s look at the child functions again.\n\nFor example, generateRoundKeys80_hls has options with area 2216.0. But generateRoundKeys80 calls copyKey and copyBlock. If we can use lower area options for copyKey and copyBlock within generateRoundKeys80, that might reduce the area of generateRoundKeys80, thus reducing the total area of present80_encryptBlock.\n\nBut in the current setup, when the user selects options for copyKey_hls and copyBlock_hls, those are used in all instances where they are called. For example, if generateRoundKeys80 calls copyKey twice, using copyKey_hls option 1 (area 529.7) each time, that contributes to the area of generateRoundKeys80. But if generateRoundKeys80\'s own options are fixed, maybe the area is already determined. Wait, no— the options for the child functions (copyKey, copyBlock) are selected by the user, and when generateRoundKeys80 is synthesized, it uses those selected options. So if the user selects lower area options for copyKey and copyBlock, then generateRoundKeys80\'s area would be lower, which in turn would lower the area of present80_encryptBlock.\n\nSo let\'s recalculate. Suppose we use the lowest area options for all possible child functions:\n\ncopyKey_hls option 1 (area 529.7)\ncopyBlock_hls option 2 (area 427.6)\ngenerateRoundKeys80_hls option 0 (area 2216.0)\naddRoundKey_hls option 2 (area 126.1)\npLayer_hls option 2 (area 719.4)\npresent80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 (area 12799.3)\n\nBut even with all child functions at their lowest area, the top function\'s area is still 12.8k. That suggests that the top function\'s area is not just the sum of the child areas but includes other components. Therefore, perhaps the options for the top function itself have a base area that\'s high, and the child functions\' areas are part of that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls is fixed based on its own options, and the child functions\' areas are separate. But according to the problem statement, when a function is synthesized in isolation, it includes the child functions. So the area reported for present80_encryptBlock_hls includes all the child functions\' areas. Therefore, if we can reduce the child functions\' areas, the total area of the top function should decrease.\n\nBut in the current setup, even with the lowest area options for all child functions, the top function\'s area is still 12.8k. That\'s way over the target. So perhaps the target is unachievable with the given options. But the user still wants to get as close as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a mistake in the options provided. For example, maybe present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 has a lower area. Wait, looking back:\n\nOption for present80_encryptBlock_hls -  area: 13187.5, latency: 1978.0, throughput: 1980.0\n\nNo, that\'s higher area. So all options for the top function are over 12k. Therefore, it\'s impossible to reach 10.5k. But the user wants to get as close as possible. So the closest would be the lowest area option for the top function, which is 12799.3 (option 2 or 3). But that\'s still 2.3k over. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the target area, or there\'s a misunderstanding. But given the information, the best possible is to select the lowest area option for the top function, which is 12799.3, and the corresponding child options that contribute to that. However, the user\'s previous attempts tried present80_encryptBlock_hls 4 (area 13187.5) and 2 (12799.3). The latency for option 4 was 1978, which is better than 2226. So perhaps option 4 for the top function has lower latency but higher area. The user\'s goal is to minimize latency while keeping area as close as possible to 10.5k. Since 12.8k is the closest, but the latency is 2226, while option 4 has lower latency (1978) but higher area (13187.5). So the trade-off is between latency and area.\n\nThe user needs to decide whether to prioritize latency or area. Since the target area is 10.5k, which is much lower than the available options, perhaps the best approach is to minimize latency, accepting that the area will be over the target. Alternatively, find a configuration that balances both.\n\nBut the problem states: "minimizes latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to a target value." So the primary objective is latency, with area as a secondary constraint. Therefore, the best solution is the configuration with the lowest latency, even if the area is over the target, but as close as possible.\n\nLooking at the options for present80_encryptBlock_hls, option 4 has the lowest latency (1978) but the highest area (13187.5). The previous synthesis with this option resulted in area 13187.5. The next best latency is 2226 with area 12799.3. Since 1978 is better in latency, but area is further from the target. The user needs to decide which is more important. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a combination of child function options that can reduce the area without increasing latency too much. For example, using lower area options for some functions and higher latency options for others. But given the options, it\'s unclear.\n\nAnother approach is to use the OR-Tools script to model this as an optimization problem. The variables are the options for each function, the objective is to minimize latency, subject to the area being as close as possible to 10500. But since the area of the top function is fixed based on its option and the child functions\' options, perhaps the script can find the best combination.\n\nBut the user might not have provided the area contributions of each function\'s options when combined. For example, if selecting a certain option for a child function reduces the parent\'s area, but the exact value isn\'t given. The problem states that the area reported for a function includes the child functions synthesized with their best latency options. So when we select a different option for a child function, the parent\'s area would change, but we don\'t have data on how much. The only data we have is the area of each function when synthesized in isolation with their best child options. Therefore, it\'s challenging to model the exact area when combining different options.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to try different combinations of child function options to see if they reduce the top function\'s area. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls can be synthesized with lower area options for its children, maybe that reduces its area, thus reducing the top function\'s area.\n\nBut in the current setup, generateRoundKeys80_hls has options with area 2216.0 regardless of the child options. That suggests that the area of generateRoundKeys80_hls is fixed, and changing child options doesn\'t affect it, which contradicts the earlier understanding. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area of each function\'s option is fixed, and the total area is the sum of all selected function options. For example, if present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 has area 12799.3, and that includes the areas of generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, etc., then the total area is 12799.3. But the target is 10500, which is impossible. Therefore, the user might have made a mistake in the problem setup, or there\'s a misunderstanding.\n\nGiven the information provided, the best possible solution is to select the configuration with the lowest latency, which is present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4, even though its area is higher. Alternatively, if the user prioritizes area, select the lowest area option for the top function (option 2 or 3) with area 12799.3. But since the target is 10500, neither is close. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the area of the top function is the sum of the areas of all its child functions. For example, if present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area is the sum of generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc., then we can calculate it. Let\'s try:\n\ngenerateRoundKeys80_hls area: 2216.0\naddRoundKey_hls (called twice?): 126.1 * 2 = 252.2\npLayer_hls: 719.4\ncopyKey_hls (called in generateRoundKeys80): 529.7 * 2 = 1059.4\ncopyBlock_hls (called in generateRoundKeys80): 427.6 * 2 = 855.2\nTotal sum: 2216 + 252.2 + 719.4 + 1059.4 + 855.2 = 2216 + 252.2 is 2468.2 + 719.4 is 3187.6 + 1059.4 is 4247 + 855.2 is 5102.2. That\'s much lower than the reported area of 12799.3 for the top function. So this approach is incorrect. Therefore, the area of the top function is not the sum of the child areas but a separate value that includes the entire design\'s resources.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that all top function options are over 12k, the target of 10.5k is unattainable. The user might need to accept that and choose the configuration with the lowest latency, which is present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4, even though the area is higher. Alternatively, if the user values area proximity more, choose the lowest area top function option (12799.3) with higher latency.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the primary goal is to minimize latency while keeping area as close as possible. Therefore, the best solution is the one with the lowest latency, even if the area is further from the target. However, the user might prefer a balance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a combination where some child functions use higher area options that allow the top function\'s area to decrease. But without knowing how child options affect the top function\'s area, it\'s hard to say. \n\nAnother approach is to run the OR-Tools script to model this as an optimization problem. The script would need to select options for each function to minimize latency, subject to the area being as close as possible to 10500. However, without knowing how the area of the top function is affected by the child options, it\'s impossible to model accurately. \n\nGiven the lack of data on how child options affect the top function\'s area, the only feasible approach is to try different configurations and see their area and latency. The user has already tried two configurations:\n\n1. present80_encryptBlock_hls 4 with child options set to lower area: resulted in area 13187.5, latency 1978.\n2. present80_encryptBlock_hls 2 with same child options: area 12799.3, latency 2226.\n\nThe second configuration has lower area but higher latency. The user needs to decide which is better. Since the target is 10.5k, neither is close, but 12799.3 is closer. However, the primary goal is latency. If the user prefers lower latency despite higher area, option 4 is better. If they prefer closer area despite higher latency, option 2 is better.\n\nBut the problem states to minimize latency while keeping area as close as possible. Therefore, the solution should be the configuration with the lowest latency that has the closest area to the target. Comparing the two:\n\n- Option 4: area 13187.5 (difference 2687.5 from target)\n- Option 2: area 12799.3 (difference 2299.3 from target)\n\nOption 2 is closer to the target area but has higher latency. Option 4 has lower latency but area further from target. Since the primary goal is latency, option 4 is better. However, the user might prefer a balance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s another configuration with a different combination of child options that results in a lower area. For example, using higher area options for some child functions to allow the top function\'s area to decrease. But without synthesis data, it\'s impossible to know.\n\nGiven the information available, the best course of action is to accept that the target area is unattainable and select the configuration with the lowest latency, which is present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4, along with the lowest area child options. Therefore, the solution would be:\n\nsolution: copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 4\n\nBut the user already tried this configuration, resulting in area 13187.5 and latency 1978. If that\'s the best possible, then that\'s the solution. However, the assistant needs to confirm if there are other configurations to try.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using different options for generateRoundKeys80_hls. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls option 4 has area 2241.9, which is slightly higher than 2216.0. But would that affect the top function\'s area? If the top function\'s area is fixed based on its own option, then changing generateRoundKeys80\'s option might not affect it. But according to the problem statement, the top function\'s area includes the child functions. So if generateRoundKeys80\'s area increases, the top function\'s area would also increase. Therefore, using generateRoundKeys80_hls option 4 would make the area worse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a different option for pLayer_hls. For example, pLayer_hls option 4 has area 867.7 and latency 47. If we use that instead of option 2 (area 719.4, latency 15), the top function\'s area might increase, but latency would increase. But since the user wants to minimize latency, using the lower latency option for pLayer_hls is better.\n\nIn conclusion, the best possible configuration is the one with the lowest latency, even if the area is over the target. Therefore, the solution is present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 with the lowest area child options.\n</think>\n\nsolution: copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 4', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=4368728129739966000)], created=1741051100, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4707, prompt_tokens=2017, total_tokens=6724), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.
