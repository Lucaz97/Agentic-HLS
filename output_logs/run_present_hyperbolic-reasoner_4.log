The synthesizable function names have an extras posfix _hls. Use this name to refer to the function in the optimization process indexing the options starting from 0.
The throughput is expressed in period, the lower the better.

The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions.
This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function.
Different options use different unrolling and pipelining factors. 

The goal is to minimize the latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 10500.

Provide your first request:

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91ad8b44d82b005e', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, let\'s start by understanding the problem. The goal is to optimize the HLS configuration of the given application to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 10500. The functions involved have multiple options each, with different area, latency, and throughput values.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the call graph to see which functions are critical. The main function calls present80_encryptBlock, which in turn calls generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, and pLayer. generateRoundKeys80 further calls copyKey and copyBlock multiple times. So, the hierarchy is important here because the parent functions\' options depend on their children\'s configurations.\n\nLooking at the options for each function:\n\n- copyKey_hls has options with varying areas (529.7 and 1527.9) and latencies (1.0 and 19.0). The lower latency options have much lower area, which is good for our target. But since generateRoundKeys80 calls copyKey twice, the choice here will affect both the latency and area of generateRoundKeys80.\n\n- copyBlock_hls has similar options, with lower area (427.6) and latency (1.0) in some options. generateRoundKeys80 calls copyBlock twice, so again, these choices will add up.\n\ngenerateRoundKeys80_hls options all have high latency (882.0) and area around 2216-2241.9. But since it\'s a parent function, its actual latency might be influenced by the child functions. Wait, the note says that the values reported for a function are from synthesizing it in isolation with the best child options. So if we change the child options, the parent\'s latency might change. But according to the given data, generateRoundKeys80\'s options have fixed latency regardless of their own options. Hmm, maybe the options for generateRoundKeys80 itself don\'t vary much, but the child functions\' options could affect the parent\'s total area and latency.\n\naddRoundKey_hls has options with latency 0.0 (options 2 and 3) which would be great for reducing overall latency. Their area is 126.1, which is much lower than the other options. So selecting these could help.\n\npLayer_hls has options with latencies ranging from 15.0 to 150.0. The lowest latency option (15.0) has area 719.4, which is better than the higher latency ones. So choosing option 2 or 3 for pLayer_hls would help reduce latency.\n\npresent80_encryptBlock_hls has options with latencies around 2226.0 except option 4, which has 1978.0. That\'s a significant drop. The area for option 4 is 13187.5, which is higher than the target of 10500. But maybe combining this with lower area options in child functions could bring the total area down.\n\nThe target area is 10500, but present80_encryptBlock\'s option 4 alone is 13187.5, which is way over. So maybe that\'s not feasible. The other options for present80_encryptBlock are around 12800, which is still over. Wait, but the total area would be the sum of all functions\' areas? Or is the area reported for each function including its children? The note says that when a function is synthesized in isolation, the child functions are included. So the area for generateRoundKeys80_hls includes the areas of copyKey and copyBlock as per their selected options. Similarly, present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area includes generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc. So the total area is just the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) because it includes all children. Wait, no. Because each function\'s options are synthesized in isolation with the best child options. So if we select different options for child functions, the parent\'s area and latency would change. But the problem is that the user provided the options for each function as synthesized in isolation, meaning that for each function\'s option, the child functions were optimized (probably using their best options for latency). So when we choose a parent function\'s option, the child functions\' options are fixed as per the parent\'s synthesis. Or maybe not. The note says: "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when a parent function is synthesized, it uses the child functions\' best options (for latency) to get the parent\'s latency and area. Therefore, if we choose a parent function\'s option, the child functions\' options are set to their best latency options. But in our case, we can choose different options for the child functions, which might not be the ones used in the parent\'s reported values. This is a bit confusing. \n\nWait, the user says: "Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function." So the parent function\'s area and latency depend on the options chosen for the child functions. Therefore, the reported values for the parent functions (like generateRoundKeys80_hls) are based on the child functions\' best options (for latency) when synthesized in isolation. But when we choose a different option for a child function, the parent\'s actual latency and area would change. Therefore, the parent\'s options might have different actual values depending on the child options selected. However, the user provided the parent\'s options with fixed area and latency, which suggests that those values are based on the child functions\' best options. So perhaps when we select a parent\'s option, the child functions are set to their own best options (for latency), but we can override that by selecting specific child options. \n\nThis is a bit unclear. Let me re-read the note: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function." \n\nAh, so when a parent function is synthesized (e.g., generateRoundKeys80_hls), it uses the child functions\' best options (for latency) to compute its own latency and area. So the reported values for generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s options are based on the child functions (copyKey, copyBlock) being set to their best latency options. But if we choose a different option for copyKey or copyBlock, then generateRoundKeys80\'s actual latency and area would change. However, the user has provided fixed values for generateRoundKeys80\'s options, which suggests that those are the values when the child functions are set to their best latency options. Therefore, if we choose a different option for a child function, the parent\'s actual latency and area would be different from the reported values. \n\nThis complicates things because the parent\'s actual performance depends on the child options selected. Therefore, the total area and latency are a combination of all selected options for all functions, considering the hierarchy. \n\nGiven that, the total area would be the sum of the areas of all selected function options, but considering that when a parent function is synthesized, it includes the child functions. Wait, no. Because if a parent function\'s area already includes the child functions\' areas (as per their selected options when the parent was synthesized), then selecting a different option for a child function would require recalculating the parent\'s area and latency. But the user hasn\'t provided that data. This is a problem because the initial data for each function\'s options are based on the child functions\' best options. \n\nTherefore, the approach must be to model the total area and latency as the sum of the individual function options selected, but considering that each function\'s area includes its children. Wait, no. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area is 2216.0 (option 0), that area includes the areas of copyKey and copyBlock as per their best options. But if we choose a different option for copyKey, then generateRoundKeys80\'s area would be different. However, the user hasn\'t provided that data. So this is a limitation. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the only way to proceed is to assume that the area and latency of each function\'s option are fixed as given, regardless of the child options selected. But the note says that selecting a different child option affects the parent\'s outcome. Therefore, this suggests that the initial data provided for the parent functions\' options are based on the child functions\' best options, and if we choose a different child option, the parent\'s actual values would change. But since we don\'t have that data, we can\'t model it. \n\nThis is a problem. The user might have made a mistake in the data provided, or perhaps the options for the parent functions already account for the child functions\' options. Alternatively, maybe each function\'s options are independent, and the total area is the sum of all selected function options. But that doesn\'t make sense because the parent functions include the child functions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area of a parent function\'s option is the area of that function plus the areas of the child functions\' options selected. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s option 0 has area 2216.0, and it calls copyKey twice and copyBlock twice, then the 2216.0 includes the areas of copyKey and copyBlock\'s options used in that synthesis. But if we choose different options for copyKey or copyBlock, then the area of generateRoundKeys80 would change. However, the user hasn\'t provided that data, so we can\'t know how it changes. \n\nThis is a critical point. Without knowing how the parent function\'s area and latency change when child options are selected, we can\'t accurately model the total area and latency. Therefore, the only way to proceed is to assume that the parent function\'s options are fixed as given, and the child functions\' options are separate. But that contradicts the note. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options for each function are independent, and the total area is the sum of all selected function options. For example, if we select option 1 for copyKey_hls (area 529.7), and generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s option 0 (area 2216.0), then the total area would be 529.7 + 2216.0 + ... etc. But this would be incorrect because generateRoundKeys80 already includes the copyKey and copyBlock functions. \n\nThis is a major confusion. Let me re-read the note again: \n\n"The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function."\n\nSo when a parent function is synthesized, the child functions are included, and their best options (for latency) are used. Therefore, the reported area and latency of the parent function\'s option include the child functions\' best options. If we choose a different option for a child function, the parent\'s area and latency would change. However, the user hasn\'t provided the data for how the parent\'s metrics change when child options are changed. Therefore, we can\'t model this. \n\nGiven this, perhaps the only way to proceed is to treat each function\'s options as independent, and the total area is the sum of all selected function options. But this is incorrect because the parent functions include the child functions. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area is 2216.0, that already includes the areas of copyKey and copyBlock. So if we select generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s option 0, we don\'t need to add the areas of copyKey and copyBlock again. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of all top-level functions (like present80_encryptBlock_hls) because they include all their children. \n\nBut in the given data, present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s options have areas around 12,800 to 13,187.5. The target is 10,500, which is lower. So even the lowest area option for present80_encryptBlock_hls (12799.3) is way over the target. This suggests that we need to find a way to reduce the area by selecting different options for child functions, which would reduce the parent\'s area. \n\nBut without knowing how the parent\'s area changes when child options are selected, we can\'t proceed. Therefore, the user must have intended that the total area is the sum of all selected function options, regardless of hierarchy. But that would be incorrect because of inclusion. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total area is the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) plus the areas of any functions not included in it. But since present80_encryptBlock_hls includes generateRoundKeys80, which includes copyKey and copyBlock, etc., the total area would just be the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls. But its options are all over 12,000, which is above the target. \n\nThis suggests that the initial data might have a mistake, or perhaps the target area is achievable by selecting lower-area options for child functions, thereby reducing the parent\'s area. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area is 2216.0 when using copyKey\'s option 1 (area 529.7) and copyBlock\'s option 2 (area 427.6), then perhaps by selecting lower-area options for copyKey and copyBlock, the generateRoundKeys80\'s area would decrease. But the user hasn\'t provided that data. \n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed under the assumption that each function\'s options are independent, and the total area is the sum of all selected function options. Even though this is incorrect in a real HLS context, it\'s the only way to proceed with the given data. \n\nAlternatively, the user might have intended that the total area is the sum of the areas of all functions, but considering that each function\'s area is reported without including children. But that\'s unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area for each function\'s option is the incremental area added by that function, not including children. But that\'s not standard. \n\nThis is a critical point. Without clarity on how the area is calculated, it\'s hard to proceed. Given the confusion, perhaps the best first step is to run a synthesis of a configuration to see what the actual total area and latency would be. \n\nFor example, let\'s try selecting the lowest latency options for all functions and see what the area is. \n\nLooking at the functions:\n\n- copyKey_hls: option 1 or 3 (area 529.7, latency 1.0)\n- copyBlock_hls: option 2 or 4 (area 427.6, latency 1.0)\n- generateRoundKeys80_hls: options 0-3 have area 2216.0, option 4 has 2241.9. Latency is 882.0 for all. So maybe option 4 has a different configuration but same latency. Not sure.\n- addRoundKey_hls: options 2 or 3 (area 126.1, latency 0.0)\n- pLayer_hls: options 2 or 3 (area 719.4, latency 15.0)\n- present80_encryptBlock_hls: option 4 has latency 1978.0, area 13187.5. Others have higher latency.\n\nIf we select the lowest latency options for all child functions, then the parent functions\' area might be lower. But according to the given data, generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area is 2216.0 regardless of the child options. That can\'t be right. So perhaps the data provided for the parent functions already includes the child functions\' best options. \n\nIn that case, the total area would be the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s option plus any other top-level functions. But main is not synthesizable, so the total area is just present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area. But its options are all over 12,000, which is above the target of 10,500. \n\nThis suggests that the target area is not achievable with the given options unless there\'s a way to reduce the area by selecting different child options, thereby reducing the parent\'s area. \n\nBut without data on how the parent\'s area changes with child options, we can\'t model this. Therefore, the user must have intended that the total area is the sum of all selected function options. For example, if we select present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s option 4 (area 13187.5), copyKey_hls\'s option 1 (529.7), etc., the total area would be the sum of all these. But that would be incorrect because present80_encryptBlock_hls already includes generateRoundKeys80, which includes copyKey and copyBlock. \n\nThis is a major issue. Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial synthesis of a configuration that uses the lowest latency options for all child functions and see what the total area and latency are. \n\nSo, let\'s try selecting the following options:\n\n- copyKey_hls: option 1 (area 529.7, latency 1.0)\n- copyBlock_hls: option 2 (area 427.6, latency 1.0)\n- generateRoundKeys80_hls: option 0 (area 2216.0, latency 882.0)\n- addRoundKey_hls: option 2 (area 126.1, latency 0.0)\n- pLayer_hls: option 2 (area 719.4, latency 15.0)\n- present80_encryptBlock_hls: option 4 (area 13187.5, latency 1978.0)\n\nBut wait, if generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area is 2216.0, which includes copyKey and copyBlock, then the total area would be present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area (13187.5) plus addRoundKey_hls (126.1) plus pLayer_hls (719.4). But that\'s not correct because present80_encryptBlock_hls already includes generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, and pLayer. \n\nThis is the crux of the problem. The user hasn\'t clarified whether the area of a parent function includes the child functions\' areas. If it does, then the total area is just the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls). But its options are all over 12,000, which is above the target. Therefore, the target can\'t be met unless there\'s a way to reduce the parent\'s area by selecting different child options. \n\nBut without data on how the parent\'s area changes with child options, we can\'t proceed. Therefore, the user must have intended that the area of each function is standalone, and the total area is the sum of all functions\' areas. But that\'s not realistic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area of a function\'s option is the area of that function alone, not including its children. Then, the total area would be the sum of all functions\' areas. For example, present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area (e.g., 12821.8) plus generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area (2216.0) plus copyKey_hls\'s area (529.7) etc. But this would lead to a very high total area, which doesn\'t make sense. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best first step is to run a synthesis of a configuration to see what the actual total area and latency are. For example, select the lowest latency options for all functions and see if the area is manageable. \n\nSo, the first step is to synthesize a configuration. Let\'s choose the lowest latency options for all functions to minimize latency, then check the area. \n\nThe functions and their options:\n\n- copyKey_hls: option 1 (area 529.7, latency 1.0)\n- copyBlock_hls: option 2 (area 427.6, latency 1.0)\n- generateRoundKeys80_hls: any option (since all have same latency, pick option 0)\n- addRoundKey_hls: option 2 (area 126.1, latency 0.0)\n- pLayer_hls: option 2 (area 719.4, latency 15.0)\n- present80_encryptBlock_hls: option 4 (latency 1978.0, area 13187.5)\n\nBut if generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area is 2216.0, and present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area is 13187.5, then the total area would be 13187.5 (assuming it includes all children). But that\'s way over the target of 10500. \n\nAlternatively, if the total area is the sum of all selected function options, then:\n\ncopyKey_hls (529.7) + copyBlock_hls (427.6) + generateRoundKeys80_hls (2216.0) + addRoundKey_hls (126.1) + pLayer_hls (719.4) + present80_encryptBlock_hls (13187.5) = 529.7 + 427.6 = 957.3; 957.3 + 2216 = 3173.3; +126.1=3299.4; +719.4=4018.8; +13187.5=17206.3. That\'s way over. \n\nBut this can\'t be right. Therefore, the correct approach must be that the area of a parent function includes the child functions. So the total area is just the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls), which is around 13,000. But the target is 10,500. So this suggests that the target is impossible unless there\'s a way to reduce the parent\'s area by selecting different child options. \n\nBut how? For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area can be reduced by selecting lower-area options for copyKey and copyBlock, but the user hasn\'t provided that data. \n\nGiven this, perhaps the only way to proceed is to use the Python script to model this as an optimization problem, trying to select options for each function to minimize latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 10500. \n\nBut to do that, we need to know how the total area is calculated. Assuming that the total area is the sum of all selected function options, but considering that parent functions include their children, which they don\'t. This is a dead end. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of all leaf functions (those not calling others) and the non-leaf functions\' areas. But that\'s unclear. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial synthesis of a configuration that uses the lowest latency options for the leaf functions and see what the area is. \n\nSo, the first step is to synthesize a configuration with the following options:\n\n- copyKey_hls: option 1 (lowest latency)\n- copyBlock_hls: option 2 (lowest latency)\n- generateRoundKeys80_hls: option 0 (since all have same latency)\n- addRoundKey_hls: option 2 (lowest latency)\n- pLayer_hls: option 2 (lowest latency)\n- present80_encryptBlock_hls: option 4 (lowest latency)\n\nBut the problem is that the user\'s options for present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s option 4 has area 13187.5, which is over the target. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a combination where the child functions\' lower area options can reduce the parent\'s area. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area can be reduced by using copyKey\'s option 1 and copyBlock\'s option 2, but the user\'s data shows generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area as 2216.0 regardless. \n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, perhaps the best first step is to run a synthesis of the configuration with the lowest latency options for all functions to see the area and latency. \n\nSo, the first request would be:\n\nsynthesis: copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 4\n\nBut I need to check the function names. The user mentioned that the synthesizable function names have an _hls suffix. The functions in the call graph are named without _hls, but the options are for functions with _hls. For example, generateRoundKeys80 in the call graph corresponds to generateRoundKeys80_hls in the options. \n\nSo, the correct function names for synthesis are:\n\ncopyKey_hls, copyBlock_hls, generateRoundKeys80_hls, addRoundKey_hls, pLayer_hls, present80_encryptBlock_hls.\n\nThus, the synthesis command would be:\n\nsynthesis: copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 4\n\nThis will test the configuration with the lowest latency options for the leaf functions and the lowest latency option for the top function. The area will likely be over the target, but this gives a baseline.\n</think>\n\nsynthesis: copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 4', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=17034530188550662000)], created=1741051152, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5465, prompt_tokens=1583, total_tokens=7048), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91ad8d5f6b4543b5', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, let\'s see. The user wants to minimize latency while keeping the area close to 10500. The last synthesis had a total area of 13187.5, which is way over the target. The latency was 1978. So I need to find a configuration that reduces the area without increasing latency too much.\n\nLooking at the functions, present80_encryptBlock_hls has the highest area. Its option 4 gives 13187.5 area and 1978 latency. Maybe using a lower option for this function could help. Let\'s check the options for present80_encryptBlock_hls. The first four options have area around 12821.8 or 12799.3, which is still high. Maybe the parent functions are contributing a lot.\n\ngenerateRoundKeys80_hls has options with area 2216.0. But it\'s called by present80_encryptBlock, so maybe optimizing its child functions can help. The child functions are copyKey, copyBlock, etc. In the last run, copyKey_hls was set to option 1 (area 529.7) and copyBlock_hls to option 2 (area 427.6). Those are already the lower area options for those functions. \n\naddRoundKey_hls was set to option 2 (area 126.1, latency 0), which is good. pLayer_hls was option 2 (area 719.4, latency 15). Maybe there\'s a higher option for pLayer_hls that has lower area but higher latency? Wait, looking at pLayer_hls options: option 2 and 3 have area 719.4, latency 15. Option 4 has area 867.7 but lower latency 47. Wait, no, higher latency. Hmm, maybe keeping pLayer_hls at option 2 is best for latency.\n\nThe main issue is the present80_encryptBlock_hls and generateRoundKeys80_hls. generateRoundKeys80_hls has options all around 2216 area. Maybe if we can reduce the area of generateRoundKeys80_hls by selecting a different option. Wait, the options for generateRoundKeys80_hls are all similar except the last one which is 2241.9. So maybe the first four options are the same. So changing generateRoundKeys80_hls might not help much.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the present80_encryptBlock_hls can be set to a lower area option. Let\'s check: present80_encryptBlock_hls options 0-3 have area around 12821.8 or 12799.3, which is still higher than option 4\'s 13187.5. Wait, no, option 4 has higher area. So maybe the previous selection was actually the best for latency but worst for area. So perhaps we need to choose a lower option for present80_encryptBlock_hls even if it increases latency, but that\'s conflicting with the goal.\n\nWait, the target area is 10500, but the current total is 13187.5. That\'s a big gap. So maybe we need to find a way to reduce the area of the top function. But how? The top function\'s area is mostly from its components. Let\'s see the breakdown. The total area is the sum of all the functions\' areas? Or is it the area of the top function which includes the child functions? The problem statement says that when a function is synthesized in isolation, the child functions are included. So the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls includes all its child functions. Therefore, the total area is just the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls, which in the last run was 13187.5. So to get closer to 10500, we need to reduce the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls by about 2687.5.\n\nLooking at the options for present80_encryptBlock_hls, the lowest area is 12799.3 (option 2 and 3), which is still 12799.3 - 10500 = 2299.3 over. That\'s not enough. So maybe the only way is to look into the child functions and see if selecting different options for them can reduce the total area.\n\nFor example, generateRoundKeys80_hls has an area of 2216.0. If we can reduce that, but its options are all similar. The last option is 2241.9, which is higher. So no help there.\n\ncopyKey_hls has options with area 529.7 (options 1,3) and 1527.9 (others). The current selection is option 1 (529.7). So that\'s already the lowest.\n\ncopyBlock_hls is at option 2 (427.6), which is the lowest. addRoundKey_hls is at option 2 (126.1), also the lowest. pLayer_hls is at option 2 (719.4). Are there lower area options for pLayer_hls? Let\'s check: option 2 and 3 are 719.4, option 4 is 867.7, option 1 is 902.8, option 0 is 1007.7. So no, option 2 is the lowest area for pLayer_hls.\n\nSo all the child functions are already at their lowest area options. Then why is the total area of present80_encryptBlock_hls so high? Maybe the top function\'s own logic adds to the area beyond the sum of the child functions. Or perhaps the options for present80_encryptBlock_hls have different implementations that affect the area. For example, option 4 has a higher area but lower latency. The other options have lower area but higher latency. Wait, looking back:\n\npresent80_encryptBlock_hls options:\n- Option 0: area 12821.8, latency 2226\n- Option 1: same as 0\n- Option 2: 12799.3, same latency\n- Option 3: same as 2\n- Option 4: 13187.5, latency 1978\n\nSo option 4 has higher area but better latency. The user wants to minimize latency but keep area close to 10500. Since the current area is way over, maybe we need to choose a lower area option for present80_encryptBlock_hls even if it increases latency. For example, option 2 has area 12799.3, which is still over, but maybe combining with other changes.\n\nWait, but the child functions are already at their minimal area. So perhaps the only way is to select a different option for present80_encryptBlock_hls that has lower area but higher latency. For example, option 2 (12799.3) is slightly lower than option 4\'s 13187.5. But that\'s still way over 10500. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the target area is the sum of all individual functions\' areas. Wait, the problem statement says "total area as close as possible to a target value". The synthesis report shows "Total Area Score: 13187.5", which is the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls including all child functions. So the target is 10500 for this total. So we need to reduce the total area by about 2687.5.\n\nBut how? The child functions are already at their minimal area. Unless there\'s a way to select different options for the child functions that, when combined, reduce the total area. Wait, but in the last run, the child functions were set to their minimal area options. Maybe there\'s a different combination where some child functions have higher area but others lower, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some functions are called multiple times, and their area is counted multiple times. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls calls copyKey and copyBlock twice each. But in HLS, if a function is instantiated multiple times, it might be shared if possible, but if not, the area could be multiplied. However, the problem statement mentions that the area reported for a function includes the child functions when synthesized in isolation. So the area of generateRoundKeys80_hls already includes the area of copyKey and copyBlock as called within it. Therefore, the total area of present80_encryptBlock_hls includes generateRoundKeys80_hls, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc., which in turn include their child functions. So the total area is just the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls as reported.\n\nIn that case, the only way to reduce the total area is to select a different option for present80_encryptBlock_hls that has a lower area, even if it increases latency. For example, option 2 has area 12799.3, which is still over, but maybe combining with other options for child functions that have lower area but higher latency. Wait, but the child functions are already at their minimal area. So perhaps there\'s no way to get the total area down to 10500. Maybe the target is unrealistic, but the user wants to get as close as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the target, but we have to proceed. So perhaps the best approach is to try different options for present80_encryptBlock_hls and see if any of them have lower area. For example, option 2 has 12799.3, which is 2299.3 over target. Maybe that\'s the closest possible. But the user wants to minimize latency. So perhaps the current configuration (option 4 for present80_encryptBlock_hls) has the lowest latency but highest area. To get closer to the target, we need to choose a lower area option for present80_encryptBlock_hls, even if it increases latency.\n\nBut the user\'s goal is to minimize latency while keeping area as close as possible to 10500. So perhaps a trade-off is needed. Let\'s see: present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 has latency 1978 and area 13187.5. Option 2 has latency 2226 and area 12799.3. The area difference is 13187.5 - 12799.3 = 388.2. So moving from option 4 to 2 reduces area by 388 but increases latency by 248. Is that worth it? The user wants to minimize latency, so maybe not. But if the area is way over, maybe we need to try other combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe other child functions can be adjusted. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls has options 0-4. The first four have area 2216.0, the last 2241.9. So using option 0-3 for generateRoundKeys80_hls would have lower area. But in the last run, generateRoundKeys80_hls was set to option 0 (area 2216.0). So that\'s already the minimal.\n\nWait, generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s options: options 0-3 have area 2216.0, option 4 has 2241.9. So using option 0 is best for area.\n\nSo perhaps the only way to reduce the total area is to select present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 (area 12799.3) and see if that helps. But that\'s still over. Maybe combining with other changes in child functions. But the child functions are already at minimal area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some functions have options that, when used in a parent, allow resource sharing, thus reducing the total area. For example, if a parent function uses a child multiple times, using a non-minimal area option for the child that allows sharing might reduce the total area. But I\'m not sure how HLS handles that. The problem statement says that the area reported for a function includes the child functions when synthesized in isolation. So if a child is called multiple times in the parent, the area might be higher than the sum of the child\'s area. But in the current setup, the area of generateRoundKeys80_hls includes the copyKey and copyBlock calls, which are called twice each. So if those are already at minimal area, maybe there\'s no way to reduce further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to explore different combinations. For example, trying present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 with generateRoundKeys80_hls option 4 (higher area but maybe better latency?), but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial configuration is the best for latency, but the area is too high. The user might need to accept a higher latency to get closer to the area target. So perhaps the next step is to try present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2, which has lower area but higher latency. Let\'s see:\n\nIf we set present80_encryptBlock_hls to option 2 (area 12799.3, latency 2226), and keep all child functions at their minimal area options, the total area would be 12799.3, which is still over but closer than 13187.5. The latency increases from 1978 to 2226. But the area is still 2299 over target. Not great.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a different combination where some child functions are not at minimal area but allow the parent to have a lower area. For example, if using a higher area option for a child function allows the parent to have a much lower area. But I\'m not sure how that would work. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls uses a different option that allows present80_encryptBlock_hls to have a lower area. But the problem statement says that the area of the parent includes the child functions. So changing generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s option would affect its area, which is part of the parent\'s area.\n\nWait, generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area is 2216.0 in option 0. If we select a different option for generateRoundKeys80_hls, say option 4 (2241.9), then the parent\'s area would increase, which is worse. So that\'s not helpful.\n\nHmm. This seems challenging. The target area is 10500, but the minimal possible area for present80_encryptBlock_hls is 12799.3, which is still way over. Maybe the user provided incorrect target, or perhaps there\'s a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the area is the sum of all individual functions\' areas when synthesized separately, but that doesn\'t seem to be the case based on the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the target is for the sum of the areas of all functions, not just the top one. For example, copyKey_hls, copyBlock_hls, etc., each synthesized separately, and their areas summed. But in that case, the total area would be the sum of all individual function areas. Let\'s calculate that:\n\nIn the last configuration:\n- copyKey_hls 1: 529.7\n- copyBlock_hls 2: 427.6\n- generateRoundKeys80_hls 0: 2216.0\n- addRoundKey_hls 2: 126.1\n- pLayer_hls 2: 719.4\n- present80_encryptBlock_hls 4: 13187.5\n\nBut if the total area is the sum of all these, that would be 529.7 + 427.6 + 2216.0 + 126.1 + 719.4 + 13187.5 = 17206.3. But the synthesis report says the total area is 13187.5, which suggests that the top function\'s area includes all the child functions. So the target is 10500 for the top function\'s area, which is 13187.5 in the last run. So the user needs to reduce that by 2687.5.\n\nBut given the options, it\'s not possible. So perhaps the best possible is to find the configuration with the lowest latency where the area is as close as possible to 10500, even if it\'s still over. Alternatively, maybe there\'s a different combination of options that somehow reduces the area. For example, if present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 uses a different set of child options that reduce the overall area. But in the last run, the child options were already at minimal area.\n\nWait, maybe the generateRoundKeys80_hls function\'s area can be reduced by selecting different options for its child functions. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls calls copyKey and copyBlock. If those are set to higher area options, maybe generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area would be lower? No, that doesn\'t make sense. If the child functions have higher area, the parent\'s area would increase.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area is fixed regardless of the child options. But according to the problem statement, when a function is synthesized in isolation, the child functions are included. So the area of generateRoundKeys80_hls includes the area of copyKey and copyBlock as per their selected options. Therefore, if we change the options for copyKey and copyBlock when generateRoundKeys80_hls is synthesized, it would affect generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area. But in the current setup, the user selects options for each function, and when a parent is synthesized, it uses the selected options for the child functions. So the area of generateRoundKeys80_hls depends on the options selected for copyKey and copyBlock.\n\nWait, this is a key point. The problem statement says: "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when you select an option for a child function, the parent function\'s synthesis uses that option. Therefore, the area of generateRoundKeys80_hls is dependent on the options selected for copyKey and copyBlock. But in the initial setup, the user provided the options for each function, including generateRoundKeys80_hls, which presumably already includes the child functions\' options. So when you select generateRoundKeys80_hls option 0, it has a certain area that includes copyKey and copyBlock\'s options. But if you change copyKey\'s option, then generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area would change. However, the options for generateRoundKeys80_hls are fixed as per the user\'s initial message. So this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the user provided the options for each function, including generateRoundKeys80_hls. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls has 5 options, each with area 2216.0 or 2241.9. So regardless of the child functions\' options, the generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s options have fixed area and latency. That suggests that the options for generateRoundKeys80_hls are independent of the child functions\' options. But that contradicts the problem statement\'s note that the child functions are included. So perhaps the options for generateRoundKeys80_hls include different implementations that may use different child function options. For example, option 0 of generateRoundKeys80_hls might use copyKey option 0 and copyBlock option 0, while option 1 uses different ones. But the user hasn\'t provided that information. \n\nThis is a critical ambiguity. If the options for parent functions include the child function options, then changing the child\'s option would require changing the parent\'s option. But according to the problem statement, the user can select options for each function independently. So perhaps the options for each function are independent, and when a parent function is synthesized, it uses the currently selected options for the child functions. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls is set to option 0, but copyKey is set to option 1, then generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area would be based on copyKey option 1. But the initial data provided for generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s options might have been synthesized with the default or best child options. \n\nThis is confusing. The problem statement says: "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when a function is synthesized, it uses the best possible (i.e., minimal latency) options for the child functions. Therefore, the area and latency reported for generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s options are based on using the best child options for latency. But when we select different options for the child functions, the parent\'s area and latency would change. \n\nThis means that the initial data provided for each function\'s options is not accurate once we start changing child function options. For example, if we set copyKey_hls to option 1 (lower area but higher latency), then generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s latency would increase because it uses copyKey_hls option 1 instead of the minimal latency option. But the initial data for generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s options assumed the best child options. \n\nThis complicates things. Therefore, the actual area and latency of a parent function depend on the options selected for its child functions. The initial data provided is when each function is synthesized in isolation with the best child options. But when we change child options, the parent\'s characteristics change. \n\nGiven this, the approach should be to model the total area and latency based on the selected options for all functions, considering the hierarchy. However, without knowing how each parent function\'s options interact with the child options, it\'s challenging. \n\nIn this case, the user\'s initial data might not account for the interdependencies, making it hard to accurately predict the total area and latency. Therefore, the agent needs to explore different combinations by synthesizing them and observing the results. \n\nGiven that the last synthesis resulted in a total area of 13187.5 and latency 1978, which is over the target area, the next step could be to try reducing the area by selecting different options for the child functions, even if it increases latency. For example, using a higher area option for generateRoundKeys80_hls might allow the parent to have a lower area. But without knowing the dependencies, it\'s a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the agent could run a Python script using OR-Tools to model the problem as an optimization problem, minimizing latency subject to the area being as close as possible to 10500. The script would need to consider the options for each function and their contributions to the total area and latency, considering the hierarchy. \n\nBut given the complexity of the dependencies, especially since the area of a parent function includes the child functions\' areas based on their selected options, the agent might need to formulate this as a combinatorial optimization problem. Each function has a set of options with area and latency. The total area is the sum of the areas of all functions, but considering that parent functions include child functions. Wait, no— the problem statement says that the area of a function includes the child functions when synthesized in isolation. So if a parent function is synthesized, its area includes the child functions\' areas based on their selected options. Therefore, the total area is just the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls), which includes all child functions. \n\nTherefore, the total area is the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls, which depends on the options selected for itself and all its descendants. Each function\'s option contributes to the total area and latency. \n\nTo model this, the agent needs to know how each function\'s option affects the parent\'s area and latency. However, the initial data only provides the area and latency for each function when synthesized in isolation with the best child options. If the child options are changed, the parent\'s characteristics would change, but the initial data doesn\'t provide that information. \n\nThis makes it impossible to accurately model without additional synthesis runs. Therefore, the agent needs to explore different configurations by synthesizing them and observing the results. \n\nGiven that, the next step could be to try a different configuration where present80_encryptBlock_hls is set to option 2 (lower area but higher latency) while keeping child functions at their minimal area options. This would test if the total area decreases as expected. \n\nAlternatively, the agent could inspect other options for the functions to see if there are any that haven\'t been considered yet. For example, checking if pLayer_hls has an option with lower area but acceptable latency. \n\nBut based on the initial data, pLayer_hls\'s minimal area is 719.4 (options 2 and 3), which is already selected. \n\nAnother approach is to use the Python script to formulate the problem. The script would need to select options for each function such that the total area (i.e., the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls) is minimized, considering the dependencies. However, without knowing how each function\'s options affect the parent\'s area, this is challenging. \n\nAlternatively, the agent could assume that the total area is the sum of the areas of all functions, but that contradicts the problem statement. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, the safest approach is to proceed with another synthesis, adjusting the options for the top function and its children to see if the area can be reduced. \n\nFor example, trying present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 with generateRoundKeys80_hls option 0, copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2. This would test if the area decreases to 12799.3, which is still over but closer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a different combination where generateRoundKeys80_hls uses a different option that allows lower area. But according to the initial data, generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s options have similar areas. \n\nAnother idea: the addRoundKey_hls has an option 2 with area 126.1 and latency 0. Maybe using a different option for addRoundKey_hls could help, but it\'s already at the minimal area. \n\nGiven all this, the agent might need to try a few more synthesis runs to gather data on how different configurations affect the total area and latency. For example, trying present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 to see if the area decreases. \n\nSo the next step would be to synthesize with present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2, keeping other functions at their current minimal area options.\n</think>\n\nsynthesis: copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 2', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=2045863602948412200)], created=1741051238, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5596, prompt_tokens=1800, total_tokens=7396), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91ad8f9eb9fdc332', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, let\'s see. The user is trying to optimize a C application using HLS. The goal is to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 10500. The current configuration uses present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4, which gives a latency of 1978 and area 13187.5. But the area is way over the target. Then they tried option 2 for present80_encryptBlock_hls, which has higher latency (2226) but lower area (12799.3). Still over 10500.\n\nHmm, maybe they need to explore other combinations. Let\'s look at the functions. The main contributors to area are generateRoundKeys80_hls and present80_encryptBlock_hls. generateRoundKeys80 has options all around 2216-2241.9 area. present80_encryptBlock options vary from 12799 to 13187.5. So those are the big ones. The target is 10500, so need to reduce area by about 2k-3k.\n\nWait, maybe the child functions can be optimized. For example, copyKey_hls has options with area 529.7 and 1527.9. They\'re using option 1 (529.7). Similarly, copyBlock_hls is using option 2 (427.6). Those are already the lower area options. addRoundKey_hls is using option 2 (126.1 area), which is the lowest. pLayer_hls is using option 2 (719.4 area). Are there lower options for pLayer? Let me check. The options for pLayer_hls are 1007.7, 902.8, 719.4, 719.4, 867.7. So options 2 and 3 are 719.4. They\'re already using the lowest here.\n\nSo the main area comes from generateRoundKeys80 and present80_encryptBlock. generateRoundKeys80\'s options are all around 2216, except option 4 which is 2241.9. present80_encryptBlock has options 12799-13187.5. The sum of generateRoundKeys80 (2216) and present80_encryptBlock (12799) is already around 15015, which is way over 10500. Wait, but maybe the area reported for present80_encryptBlock includes the child functions? Because when you synthesize a parent function, it includes the child functions. So the total area is the sum of all the functions used, but perhaps the present80_encryptBlock\'s area already includes generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc. Because in HLS, when you synthesize a top function, it includes all the sub-functions. So the area reported for present80_encryptBlock_hls is the total area including its children. So the total area is just the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls, which is around 12k-13k. The target is 10.5k, so we need to reduce that by about 2k.\n\nLooking at the options for present80_encryptBlock_hls, the lowest area is 12799.3 (option 2 and 3), but that\'s still over. The other options are higher. So maybe the only way to reduce area is to find a configuration where the child functions have lower area, which would reduce the total area of the top function.\n\nWait, but the child functions like generateRoundKeys80_hls have their own options. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls has options 0-4, all around 2216 except option 4 is 2241.9. If we can choose a lower area option for generateRoundKeys80, but looking at the options, they are all similar. So maybe the only way is to look at other functions.\n\nWait, the user tried two configurations. The first had present80_encryptBlock_hls 4, which has lower latency (1978) but higher area (13187.5). The second tried present80_encryptBlock_hls 2, which has higher latency but lower area (12799.3). Both are over the target area. So maybe they need to find a way to reduce the area further by adjusting other functions.\n\nWait, but the child functions like generateRoundKeys80_hls might have their own child functions. For example, generateRoundKeys80 calls copyKey and copyBlock. The current configuration uses copyKey_hls 1 (area 529.7) and copyBlock_hls 2 (427.6). Are there lower options for these? Looking at the options, copyKey_hls options are 1527.9, 529.7, 1527.9, 529.7, 1527.9. So options 1 and 3 are 529.7. They are already using the lowest. Similarly, copyBlock_hls options are 1175.3, 1175.3, 427.6, 1175.3, 427.6. They are using option 2 (427.6), which is the lowest. So those are already optimized for area.\n\nSo the main area is in generateRoundKeys80 and present80_encryptBlock. But generateRoundKeys80\'s area is part of present80_encryptBlock\'s area. So the total area is the area of present80_encryptBlock, which includes all its children. Therefore, to reduce the total area, we need to find a configuration of present80_encryptBlock and its children that has lower area.\n\nLooking at the present80_encryptBlock options, the lowest area is 12799.3 (options 2 and 3). The next step is to see if there\'s a way to get even lower. Maybe by adjusting the options of generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc., which are part of present80_encryptBlock.\n\nFor example, generateRoundKeys80_hls has options 0-4. The area for generateRoundKeys80 is 2216.0 for options 0-3, and 2241.9 for option 4. So using option 0-3 gives lower area. But in the current configuration, they are using option 0. So that\'s already the lowest.\n\naddRoundKey_hls has options with area 424.1, 423.6, 126.1, 126.1, 423.6. They are using option 2 (126.1), which is the lowest. pLayer_hls is using option 2 (719.4), which is the lowest possible. So those are already optimized for area.\n\nSo the only way to reduce the total area is to find a present80_encryptBlock_hls option that has lower area. But the options provided don\'t go below 12799.3, which is still over 10500. That\'s a problem. Maybe the target area is too low given the current function options. Alternatively, perhaps there\'s a combination where some functions are optimized for area even if it increases latency, but the user wants to minimize latency. But the target area is 10500, and the current best is 12799.3, which is 22% over. So maybe the user needs to relax the area target, but the problem states to keep it as close as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a mistake in understanding the area reporting. If the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls includes all child functions, then perhaps the total area is just that value. But the target is 10500, and the current best is 12799.3. So perhaps the user needs to find a way to reduce the area further. But given the options, it\'s not possible. Unless there\'s a different combination of options for the child functions that, when synthesized together, result in a lower total area.\n\nWait, maybe the user hasn\'t tried all possible combinations. For example, maybe using a different option for generateRoundKeys80_hls. Let\'s see: generateRoundKeys80_hls has options 0-4. The area is 2216.0 for options 0-3, and 2241.9 for option 4. So using option 0-3 is better. But in the current configuration, they are using option 0. Maybe trying a different option for generateRoundKeys80_hls could affect the parent\'s area. But according to the data, the present80_encryptBlock_hls options have their own area values, which might already include the generateRoundKeys80\'s area. So changing generateRoundKeys80\'s option might not affect the present80_encryptBlock\'s area if the present80_encryptBlock\'s option already includes a specific generateRoundKeys80 option.\n\nWait, the user\'s initial synthesis commands include specifying options for all functions. For example, in the first synthesis, they chose generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, which has area 2216.0. But the present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 has area 13187.5. So perhaps the present80_encryptBlock\'s area is computed based on the options selected for its child functions. Therefore, changing the child function options would affect the total area of the parent.\n\nWait, but in the problem description, it says: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when a function is synthesized in isolation, it uses the best latency options for its children. But when we select specific options for the children, that might override the "best" selection. Therefore, the total area when synthesizing the top function would be the sum of the areas of all the selected options for each function. Or is the area of the top function including the child functions\' areas based on the selected options?\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\n"The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function."\n\nAh, so when a function is synthesized, it includes the child functions, and the reported area is the total area of the parent plus the child functions. But when you select a specific option for a child function, that affects the parent\'s synthesis. So the area of the parent function\'s option is dependent on the child functions\' options. Therefore, the total area is the sum of the areas of all the selected options. Wait, no. Because when you synthesize the parent function with a specific option, it uses the selected options for the child functions, and the area reported for the parent includes the child functions\' areas based on their selected options. So the total area is the area of the parent function\'s option, which already accounts for the child functions\' selected options.\n\nWait, but in the initial data, each function\'s options have their own area, which includes the child functions. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls option 0 has area 2216.0, which includes copyKey and copyBlock. But when present80_encryptBlock_hls is synthesized, it includes generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc. So the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s option includes all the child functions\' areas based on their selected options.\n\nTherefore, the total area is the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) plus any functions not included in it. But since main is not synthesized, the total area is just the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s option, which includes all its children. Therefore, the user\'s target is to have present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area as close as possible to 10500. But the options for present80_encryptBlock_hls are all around 12.8k to 13.1k. So it\'s impossible to reach 10.5k with the given options. Therefore, the best possible is to choose the option with the lowest area, which is 12799.3 (options 2 and 3), and the lowest latency among those. But the user wants to minimize latency. The present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 has lower latency (1978) but higher area (13187.5). So there\'s a trade-off.\n\nThe user needs to find the configuration that balances latency and area. Since the target is 10.5k, which is lower than any available option, the closest would be the lowest area option (12799.3), which is 22% over. Alternatively, maybe combining different child function options can reduce the total area further. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls can be optimized more, but according to the options, it\'s already at 2216.0. Maybe using a different option for generateRoundKeys80_hls that has lower area? But the options don\'t show any lower. Similarly for other functions.\n\nWait, maybe the user hasn\'t tried all possible combinations. For example, present80_encryptBlock_hls has option 4 with area 13187.5 and latency 1978. Option 2 has area 12799.3 and latency 2226. So option 4 is better in latency but worse in area. The user needs to find a balance. But the target area is 10500, which is much lower. So perhaps the user should try to find a configuration where the sum of the areas of all functions is closer to 10500. But if the top function\'s area is the sum, then it\'s not possible. Alternatively, maybe the area is additive. For example, if each function\'s area is considered separately, and the total is the sum. But according to the problem statement, when a function is synthesized, it includes the child functions. So the area of the top function includes all children. Therefore, the total area is just the area of the top function. So the options for present80_encryptBlock_hls are the total areas. Therefore, the user can\'t get below 12.7k. So the best they can do is pick the lowest area option (12799.3) and accept that it\'s over the target. Alternatively, maybe there\'s a way to mix and match options for child functions to get a lower total area. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls uses a different option that has lower area, but according to the data, all its options are around 2216. So no gain there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can use a different option for pLayer_hls. For example, pLayer_hls option 2 is 719.4, but maybe using a higher option with lower latency but higher area. Wait, but the goal is to minimize latency. So if using a higher latency option for pLayer, that would increase the total latency. But the user wants to minimize latency. So perhaps the current configuration is already optimal for latency, but the area is too high. \n\nGiven that the target area is 10500 and the best available is 12799.3, the user might have to accept that the closest possible is 12799.3. But maybe there\'s a combination where some functions are optimized for area and others for latency, leading to a total area closer to 10500. But given the data, it\'s unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should run a Python script using OR-Tools to model this as an optimization problem, minimizing latency subject to the area being as close as possible to 10500. The script would need to consider all possible combinations of function options and select the one with the lowest latency and area closest to the target. \n\nThe functions and their options are:\n\n- copyKey_hls: options 0-4, area 1527.9, 529.7, 1527.9, 529.7, 1527.9. Latency 19,1,19,1,19.\n- copyBlock_hls: options 0-4, area 1175.3, 1175.3, 427.6, 1175.3, 427.6. Latency 15,15,1,15,1.\n- generateRoundKeys80_hls: options 0-4, area 2216.0, 2216.0, 2216.0, 2216.0, 2241.9. Latency 882 for all.\n- addRoundKey_hls: options 0-4, area 424.1, 423.6, 126.1, 126.1, 423.6. Latency 14,14,0,0,14.\n- pLayer_hls: options 0-4, area 1007.7, 902.8, 719.4, 719.4, 867.7. Latency 150,79,15,15,47.\n- present80_encryptBlock_hls: options 0-4, area 12821.8, 12821.8, 12799.3, 12799.3, 13187.5. Latency 2226,2226,2226,2226,1978.\n\nBut wait, the present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area includes all child functions. So if we select options for the child functions, the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls would change accordingly. But according to the problem statement, the area reported for each function\'s option is when synthesized in isolation with the best latency for child functions. So when we select specific options for child functions, the parent\'s area might be different. Therefore, the total area is not just the sum of all selected function options, but the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) when synthesized with the selected child function options.\n\nThis complicates things because the area of the top function depends on the options chosen for its children. Therefore, the user needs to find the combination of options for all functions such that when present80_encryptBlock_hls is synthesized with those options, its area is as close as possible to 10500 and latency is minimized.\n\nBut the user doesn\'t have data on how each combination of child options affects the top function\'s area and latency. They have to synthesize each combination to get the results. So the previous synthesis attempts are two data points. The first had present80_encryptBlock_hls 4 with area 13187.5 and latency 1978. The second had present80_encryptBlock_hls 2 with area 12799.3 and latency 2226. \n\nTo find a better combination, the user might need to try other options. For example, maybe using a different option for generateRoundKeys80_hls. But according to the data, all its options have similar area and latency. Or trying different options for pLayer_hls. For example, using option 3 for pLayer_hls (same area as option 2 but maybe different latency? The data shows option 2 and 3 for pLayer_hls have the same area and latency. So no difference. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using a higher option for copyKey_hls or copyBlock_hls that has higher latency but lower area. Wait, copyKey_hls option 1 has area 529.7 and latency 1. That\'s already the best. Similarly for copyBlock_hls option 2 and 4 (area 427.6, latency 1). So those are optimal.\n\nThe addRoundKey_hls options 2 and 3 have area 126.1 and latency 0. So those are optimal.\n\nThe pLayer_hls options 2 and 3 are the best for area and latency.\n\nThe generateRoundKeys80_hls options 0-3 have area 2216.0, which is the lowest.\n\nSo the only variable is the present80_encryptBlock_hls option. The user has tried options 4 and 2. The other options (0,1,3) have area 12821.8 or 12799.3. So option 2 and 3 are the same. \n\nTherefore, the minimal area achievable is 12799.3, which is still over the target. The user might have to accept that and choose the configuration with the lowest latency among the lowest area options. The present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 has lower latency (1978) but higher area (13187.5). The user needs to decide whether to prioritize latency or area proximity. \n\nSince the goal is to minimize latency while keeping area as close as possible to 10500, perhaps the best approach is to find the configuration with the lowest latency where the area is as close as possible. The two data points are:\n\n1. Area 13187.5, latency 1978 (difference 2687.5 from target)\n2. Area 12799.3, latency 2226 (difference 2299.3 from target)\n\nThe second is closer to the target area. So maybe that\'s better. But perhaps there\'s another configuration with a better trade-off. For example, using present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 but with different child options that reduce the area. But according to the data, the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 is 13187.5, which is higher than option 2\'s 12799.3. So unless changing child options can reduce the area of the top function, which isn\'t clear from the data provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should run a Python script to model this as an optimization problem. The script would need to consider all possible combinations of function options, calculate the total area and latency, and find the combination that minimizes latency while keeping area as close as possible to 10500. However, without knowing how the child function options affect the parent\'s area and latency, this is challenging. The data provided for each function\'s options includes their area and latency when synthesized in isolation with best child options. But when selecting specific child options, the parent\'s area and latency may change. \n\nGiven the complexity, the user might need to try more synthesis configurations to gather data points. For example, trying present80_encryptBlock_hls option 3 (same as 2) to confirm area, or trying different child function options to see if they affect the top function\'s area. But based on the current information, the best option is to choose present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 or 3 with area 12799.3 and latency 2226, which is the closest to the target area. Alternatively, if latency is more critical, option 4 with area 13187.5 and latency 1978. \n\nBut the user\'s goal is to minimize latency while keeping area as close as possible to 10500. Since 12799.3 is closer to 10500 than 13187.5, the configuration with present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 or 3 is better in terms of area, even though it has higher latency. However, the user might need to explore if there\'s a configuration that balances both. \n\nAnother approach is to use the Python script to formulate this as a constrained optimization problem. The script would select function options to minimize latency subject to the area being as close as possible to 10500. Here\'s how the script might look:\n\nThe variables are the options for each function. The objective is to minimize the latency of present80_encryptBlock_hls, which is the sum of the latencies of all functions in its call graph. Wait, no. The latency of the top function is given in its option. For example, present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 has latency 1978. So the latency is determined by the option chosen for the top function. Similarly, the area is the area of the top function\'s option. Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting the option for present80_encryptBlock_hls that has the lowest latency and area closest to 10500. \n\nBut the options for present80_encryptBlock_hls are fixed in terms of their area and latency. Therefore, the script would just compare these options and pick the one with the minimal latency and area closest to 10500. \n\nLooking at the present80_encryptBlock_hls options:\n\n- Options 0-3: area ~12821.8, 12799.3; latency 2226\n- Option 4: area 13187.5, latency 1978\n\nThe closest area to 10500 is 12799.3 (options 2 and 3), which is 2299.3 over. Option 4 is 2687.5 over. So options 2 and 3 are better in area. But their latency is higher. The user has to decide between lower latency (option 4) or closer area (options 2/3). \n\nSince the goal is to minimize latency while keeping area as close as possible, the user might prefer option 4 if the area difference is acceptable. But according to the problem statement, the area should be as close as possible. Therefore, the best solution is to choose the configuration with the closest area, which is options 2 or 3 for present80_encryptBlock_hls, along with the optimal child function options (copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2). \n\nBut the user already tried that configuration and got area 12799.3. Since that\'s the closest possible, the solution would be to accept that configuration.\n</think>\n\nsolution: copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 2', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=14764968337585687000)], created=1741051330, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5480, prompt_tokens=2017, total_tokens=7497), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.
