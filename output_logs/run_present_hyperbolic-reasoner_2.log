The synthesizable function names have an extras posfix _hls. Use this name to refer to the function in the optimization process indexing the options starting from 0.
The throughput is expressed in period, the lower the better.

The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions.
This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function.
Different options use different unrolling and pipelining factors. 

The goal is to minimize the latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 10500.

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91ad7e5308860f78', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, let\'s start by understanding the problem. The goal is to optimize the HLS configuration for the given application to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 10500. The functions involved have multiple options with different area, latency, and throughput values.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the call graph to see which functions are critical. The main function calls present80_encryptBlock, which in turn calls generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, and pLayer. generateRoundKeys80 further calls copyKey and copyBlock multiple times. So, the hierarchy is important here because the parent functions\' options will depend on their children\'s configurations.\n\nLooking at the options for each function:\n\n- copyKey_hls has options with areas ranging from ~529 to ~1527 and latencies from 1 to 19. The lower latency options (index 1,3) have much lower area and better latency. Since copyKey is called twice by generateRoundKeys80, using the low-latency options here could help reduce the overall latency of generateRoundKeys80.\n\n- copyBlock_hls has options with areas ~427 to ~1175 and latencies 1 to 15. Similarly, the lower latency options (index 2,4) are better for latency but have lower area. Since copyBlock is called twice in generateRoundKeys80, optimizing these could also help.\n\n- generateRoundKeys80_hls has all options with area around 2216-2241 and latency 882. The options don\'t vary much except the last one which has a slightly higher area but same latency. Maybe the child functions\' options affect this, but the parent\'s options here don\'t change much. So selecting the option with the lowest area (index 0-3) might be better.\n\n- addRoundKey_hls has options with area ~126 to ~424 and latency 0 or 14. The options with latency 0 (index 2,3) are very attractive for reducing latency. Their area is also much lower, which is great.\n\n- pLayer_hls has options with varying latencies from 15 to 150. The lowest latency is 15 (index 2,3), which also has a moderate area (~719). Choosing these would help reduce the latency in present80_encryptBlock.\n\n- present80_encryptBlock_hls has options with area ~12799 to ~13187 and latency 1978 to 2226. The last option (index 4) has a lower latency (1978) but higher area (13187.5). Since the target area is 10500, this might be too high. The other options have higher latency but lower area (~12821). However, the parent\'s area includes all child functions, so maybe selecting lower area options for the children can bring the total down.\n\nThe target area is 10500, but the present80_encryptBlock alone is around 12821 in its base options, which already exceeds the target. This suggests that the child functions\' areas are included in the parent\'s area. Wait, the problem statement says that the values reported for a function are obtained by synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. So when a parent function is synthesized, it includes the child functions\' areas. Therefore, the total area of the entire application would be the area of the top function (main), but main\'s options aren\'t provided. However, main calls present80_encryptBlock and printf. Since printf is likely a library function, the main area is probably dominated by present80_encryptBlock. So the total area is approximately the area of present80_encryptBlock plus any other functions not inlined. But according to the problem, the total area should be close to 10500. However, the present80_encryptBlock\'s options start at 12799, which is already higher than 10500. This suggests that maybe the child functions\' areas are part of the parent\'s area, and by selecting different options for the children, we can reduce the overall area.\n\nWait, the problem says that when a function is synthesized in isolation, the child functions are included. So the area reported for generateRoundKeys80_hls includes the areas of copyKey and copyBlock. Similarly, present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area includes generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc. Therefore, the total area of the application is the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) because it includes all the children. But the present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s options have areas around 12,800 to 13,187, which is way above the target of 10,500. This is a problem. How can we get the total area down to 10,500?\n\nWait, maybe the target is the sum of all individual function areas when synthesized in isolation. But that doesn\'t make sense because the parent functions include the children. Alternatively, perhaps the target is the sum of the areas of all functions when each is synthesized with their selected options, but without considering hierarchy. But that\'s unclear. The problem statement says: "the total area as close as possible to a target value". So perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of all functions in their selected configurations. But when a parent function is synthesized, it includes the child functions, so their areas are already part of the parent\'s area. Therefore, the total area would be the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) plus any functions not included in it, like main. But main\'s options aren\'t given, so maybe main is not synthesized and is part of the testbench. Therefore, the total area is just the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls. But its options are all around 12,800 to 13,187, which is way over 10,500. This suggests that the target is impossible unless there\'s a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the target is the sum of the areas of all the functions selected, but considering that when a parent function includes a child, the child\'s area is not added again. For example, if present80_encryptBlock includes generateRoundKeys80, then the area of generateRoundKeys80 is part of present80_encryptBlock\'s area. Therefore, the total area is the area of present80_encryptBlock. But that\'s still over 12k. So how can we reach 10,500? Maybe the target is a mistake, or perhaps I\'m misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the options for the functions are for their individual implementations, and when combined, the total area is the sum of all the functions\' areas. For example, if present80_encryptBlock uses generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, etc., each with their own options, then the total area is the sum of all these functions\' areas. But that contradicts the note that the parent\'s synthesis includes the child functions. So the parent\'s area already includes the child\'s area. Therefore, the total area is the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) because it includes all the children. But that\'s way over the target. So perhaps the target is a typo, or maybe there\'s a way to reduce the area by selecting lower-area options for the children, which would reduce the parent\'s area.\n\nWait, let\'s look at the options again. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls has an area of 2216.0 in option 0. But generateRoundKeys80 calls copyKey and copyBlock. If we select lower-area options for copyKey and copyBlock, would that reduce the area of generateRoundKeys80? The problem statement says that the values reported for a function are obtained by synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. So when generateRoundKeys80 is synthesized with option 0, it includes the best (lowest latency) options for copyKey and copyBlock. But if we manually select different options for copyKey and copyBlock, that would change the area and latency of generateRoundKeys80. Wait, no. The problem says that each function\'s options are different implementations (e.g., different unrolling or pipelining) and that the child functions are included. So the options for generateRoundKeys80_hls are different implementations that may use different options for the child functions. But the user provided the options for each function, including the child functions. So when you select an option for generateRoundKeys80_hls, it\'s already using certain options for its children (copyKey, copyBlock), but the user hasn\'t provided that information. Wait, the problem says: "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when generateRoundKeys80 is synthesized, it uses the best (lowest latency) options for copyKey and copyBlock. Therefore, the area reported for generateRoundKeys80 includes the area of copyKey and copyBlock with their best latency options. But in our optimization, we can choose different options for copyKey and copyBlock, which may have higher latency but lower area. However, that would affect the parent\'s latency. For example, if generateRoundKeys80 uses a slower copyKey (higher latency but lower area), then generateRoundKeys80\'s latency would increase, but the area might decrease. But the problem is that the options for generateRoundKeys80 are fixed, and their area and latency are already considering the best child options. So perhaps the options for the parent functions are fixed, and we can only choose the options for the leaf functions (like copyKey, copyBlock, addRoundKey, pLayer) and the top functions (generateRoundKeys80, present80_encryptBlock). Wait, the user provided options for all functions, including the parents. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls has 5 options, each with area 2216-2241 and latency 882. So regardless of the options chosen for copyKey and copyBlock, the generateRoundKeys80\'s options have fixed area and latency. That can\'t be right. There\'s a contradiction here. \n\nWait, the problem statement says: "Different options use different unrolling and pipelining factors." So each option for a function represents a different HLS directive (like pipeline, unroll) applied to that function. The child functions\' options are selected to minimize latency when the parent is synthesized. But when we choose an option for a child function, it affects the parent\'s area and latency. However, the user has provided the options for each function, including the parents, which already include the optimal child options. Therefore, if we choose a non-optimal child option (e.g., higher latency but lower area), the parent\'s latency would increase, but the area might decrease. However, the parent\'s options as given have fixed area and latency, which suggests that the parent\'s options are independent of the child\'s options. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options for each function are independent, and the total area is the sum of all selected function options. For example, if we select option 1 for copyKey_hls (area 529.7), option 2 for copyBlock_hls (area 427.6), etc., then the total area is the sum of all these selected options. But that would mean that functions called multiple times (like copyKey called twice in generateRoundKeys80) would have their area counted twice. But that\'s not how HLS works; each function is synthesized once, and its area is counted once, regardless of how many times it\'s called. So the total area would be the sum of the areas of all functions in their selected options. However, the problem states that the parent\'s area includes the child functions. So if generateRoundKeys80 is included in present80_encryptBlock, then generateRoundKeys80\'s area is part of present80_encryptBlock\'s area. Therefore, the total area would be the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls plus any functions not included in it, like main. But main\'s area isn\'t given, so perhaps it\'s negligible or part of the testbench. Therefore, the total area is just the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls. But its options are all over 12k, which is above the target of 10.5k. This suggests that the target is impossible unless there\'s a way to reduce the area by selecting different options for the child functions, thereby reducing the parent\'s area.\n\nWait, perhaps the options for the parent functions (like generateRoundKeys80_hls) are not fixed, but depend on the options selected for their children. For example, if we choose a lower-area option for copyKey_hls, then generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area would decrease. But the user has provided fixed options for generateRoundKeys80_hls, which suggests that those options already include certain child configurations. This is unclear. The problem statement says: "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when generateRoundKeys80 is synthesized, it uses the child functions\' best (lowest latency) options. Therefore, the area reported for generateRoundKeys80 includes the area of the child functions with their best latency options. But in our optimization, we can choose different options for the child functions (e.g., higher latency but lower area), which would affect the parent\'s area and latency. However, the parent\'s options as given have fixed area and latency, which suggests that those options are for different implementations of the parent function itself (like different pipelining) regardless of the child functions. This is conflicting.\n\nThis confusion makes it hard to proceed. Let\'s try to approach this step by step.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the latency of the entire application (which is determined by the present80_encryptBlock\'s latency) while keeping the total area close to 10500. The present80_encryptBlock\'s options have areas around 12.8k to 13.1k, which is higher than the target. So unless there\'s a way to reduce the area by selecting different child options, the target can\'t be met. Therefore, perhaps the child functions\' options can be chosen to reduce the area of the parent functions.\n\nFor example, generateRoundKeys80_hls has an area of 2216.0 in option 0. If we can choose lower-area options for copyKey and copyBlock, which are called by generateRoundKeys80, then the area of generateRoundKeys80 might decrease. However, according to the problem statement, the area reported for generateRoundKeys80 already includes the child functions\' areas when synthesized with their best latency options. So if we choose a different option for copyKey (e.g., option 1 with lower area but higher latency), then generateRoundKeys80\'s area would decrease, but its latency would increase. However, the generateRoundKeys80\'s options provided have fixed latency and area, which suggests that those are independent of the child options. This is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options for the parent functions are different implementations that may use different child options. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls option 0 might use copyKey option 0 and copyBlock option 0, while option 4 might use different child options. But the user hasn\'t provided that information, making it impossible to model.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed under the assumption that the total area is the sum of all selected function options, and the parent functions\' options do not include the child functions\' areas. But that contradicts the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of all functions in their selected options, considering that each function is synthesized once. For example, if present80_encryptBlock calls generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, etc., and each of those functions have their own options, then the total area is the sum of present80_encryptBlock\'s area plus generateRoundKeys80\'s area, etc. But that would lead to double-counting, as generateRoundKeys80 is part of present80_encryptBlock. This is not correct.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the initial step is to run a synthesis of a baseline configuration to see what the total area and latency are. For example, select the lowest latency options for all functions and see the area. Then adjust from there.\n\nThe present80_encryptBlock\'s lowest latency option is index 4 with latency 1978 and area 13187.5. But this is over the target area. The other options have higher latency but slightly lower area (12799.3 to 12821.8). Still, all are over 12k. So even the lowest area option for present80_encryptBlock is 12799.3, which is way above 10500. This suggests that the target area is impossible unless there\'s a way to reduce the area by selecting different child options.\n\nWait, perhaps the present80_encryptBlock\'s area is the sum of its own implementation plus the areas of its children. For example, if present80_encryptBlock is synthesized with option 0, which has area 12821.8, and that includes generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc., each with their own options. So if we can choose lower-area options for generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, and pLayer, then the total area of present80_encryptBlock would decrease.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the area of generateRoundKeys80 is 2216.0 (option 0), which includes its children. If we choose a lower-area option for generateRoundKeys80, that would help. But generateRoundKeys80\'s options are all around 2216-2241, so not much variation. Similarly, addRoundKey has options with area as low as 126.1 (index 2,3), which is much lower than the higher options. pLayer_hls has options as low as 719.4 (index 2,3). So if we select lower-area options for these child functions, the total area of present80_encryptBlock would decrease.\n\nBut how does the selection of child function options affect the parent\'s area and latency? For example, if generateRoundKeys80 is called by present80_encryptBlock, and we choose a lower-area option for generateRoundKeys80, then present80_encryptBlock\'s area would decrease by the difference in generateRoundKeys80\'s area. Similarly, the latency of present80_encryptBlock would depend on the latencies of its children.\n\nBut the problem states that the parent\'s latency is the sum of the latencies of its children plus its own. Or is it the critical path? For example, if generateRoundKeys80 has a latency of 882, and addRoundKey has 0, and pLayer has 15, then the total latency of present80_encryptBlock would be the sum of these plus its own overhead. But the present80_encryptBlock\'s options have latencies around 1978-2226, which likely includes the sum of its children\'s latencies.\n\nTherefore, to minimize the total latency, we need to minimize the sum of the latencies of all functions in the critical path. The critical path is from main to present80_encryptBlock, which calls generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc. generateRoundKeys80\'s latency is 882, which is a major contributor. If we can reduce that, it would help. But generateRoundKeys80\'s options all have the same latency of 882, except the last option which also has 882. So no help there. However, generateRoundKeys80\'s latency might depend on the latencies of copyKey and copyBlock. For example, if copyKey has a latency of 1 (option 1,3) and copyBlock has 1 (option 2,4), then generateRoundKeys80\'s latency might be lower. But according to the given data, generateRoundKeys80\'s latency is fixed at 882 regardless of the child options. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the latency of generateRoundKeys80 is fixed because it\'s determined by its own implementation, and the child latencies are part of that. For example, if generateRoundKeys80 calls copyKey twice and copyBlock twice, and each copyKey takes 1 cycle (option 1), and copyBlock takes 1 cycle (option 2), then the total latency for generateRoundKeys80 would be 2*1 + 2*1 = 4 cycles plus any overhead. But the reported latency for generateRoundKeys80 is 882, which is way higher. This suggests that the generateRoundKeys80\'s latency is dominated by its own processing, not the children. Therefore, the child functions\' latencies are negligible compared to the parent\'s. But that contradicts the data, as copyKey\'s latency can be 19 cycles, which would add up if called multiple times.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Perhaps the best approach is to start by synthesizing a configuration with the lowest latency options for all functions to see the total area and latency. Then adjust from there to reduce the area towards the target.\n\nThe lowest latency options would be:\n\n- copyKey_hls: option 1 or 3 (latency 1, area 529.7)\n- copyBlock_hls: option 2 or 4 (latency 1, area 427.6)\n- generateRoundKeys80_hls: any option (latency 882, area ~2216)\n- addRoundKey_hls: option 2 or 3 (latency 0, area 126.1)\n- pLayer_hls: option 2 or 3 (latency 15, area 719.4)\n- present80_encryptBlock_hls: option 4 (latency 1978, area 13187.5)\n\nBut the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 is 13187.5, which is way over the target. However, if the child functions\' areas are part of the parent\'s area, then selecting lower-area options for the children might reduce the parent\'s area. For example, if generateRoundKeys80\'s area is 2216, but we choose lower-area options for copyKey and copyBlock, maybe generateRoundKeys80\'s area would decrease, thus reducing present80_encryptBlock\'s area.\n\nBut according to the given data, generateRoundKeys80\'s options have fixed area regardless of the child options. This suggests that the child options are fixed when the parent is synthesized. Therefore, the user\'s provided options for each function already include the optimal child options for latency. Therefore, to reduce the area, we need to choose higher-latency but lower-area options for the child functions, which would increase the parent\'s latency but decrease the total area.\n\nFor example, if we choose copyKey_hls option 1 (area 529.7, latency 1) instead of option 0 (area 1527.9, latency 19), but wait, option 1 has lower area and lower latency. That\'s better in both aspects. So why would anyone choose option 0? Maybe there\'s a mistake in the data. Looking back:\n\nOptions for copyKey_hls:\n- Option 0: area 1527.9, latency 19.0\n- Option 1: area 529.7, latency 1.0\n- Option 2: same as 0\n- Option 3: same as 1\n- Option 4: same as 0\n\nSo options 0,2,4 are high area and high latency; options 1,3 are low area and low latency. So obviously, choosing options 1 or 3 for copyKey_hls is better in both aspects. Similarly for copyBlock_hls, options 2 and 4 are better (lower area and latency). So why are there multiple options with the same values? Maybe they represent different HLS directives, but in this case, the best options are clear.\n\nTherefore, for copyKey_hls and copyBlock_hls, the best options are the ones with latency 1 and lower area. For addRoundKey_hls, options 2 and 3 have latency 0 and area 126.1, which is better. For pLayer_hls, options 2 and 3 have latency 15 and area 719.4. For generateRoundKeys80_hls, all options have the same latency 882, so choose the one with the lowest area (option 0-3, area 2216.0). For present80_encryptBlock_hls, option 4 has the lowest latency (1978) but highest area (13187.5). The other options have higher latency but slightly lower area.\n\nIf we select the best options for all child functions, the total area would be the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 (13187.5) plus the areas of the other functions? No, because present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area already includes the child functions. So the total area is 13187.5, which is way over the target. Therefore, we need to find a way to reduce the area by selecting higher-latency but lower-area options for some functions.\n\nFor example, if we choose a higher-latency option for generateRoundKeys80_hls that has a lower area. But all generateRoundKeys80_hls options have area around 2216, except option 4 which is 2241.9. So no help there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls can be reduced by selecting lower-area options for its child functions. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area is 2216, but if we can reduce that by selecting different options for copyKey and copyBlock, which are part of generateRoundKeys80. But according to the problem statement, generateRoundKeys80\'s area already includes the best child options. So if we choose a different option for copyKey, which has lower area but higher latency, then generateRoundKeys80\'s area would decrease, but its latency would increase. However, the generateRoundKeys80\'s options provided have fixed area and latency, which suggests that those are independent of the child options. This is conflicting.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to run a synthesis of the configuration with the lowest latency options for all functions to get a baseline. Then, if the area is too high, start replacing some child function options with higher-latency but lower-area ones to reduce the total area.\n\nBut according to the data, the lowest latency options for the child functions (copyKey, copyBlock, addRoundKey, pLayer) also have the lowest area. So there\'s no trade-off there. For example, copyKey\'s option 1 has lower area and lower latency than option 0. So there\'s no need to choose a higher-latency option for area reduction in these functions. The only trade-off is in present80_encryptBlock_hls: option 4 has lower latency but higher area, while the others have higher latency but slightly lower area.\n\nWait, present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 has area 13187.5 and latency 1978, while option 0 has area 12821.8 and latency 2226. So option 4 is better in latency but worse in area. The target area is 10500, which is much lower than 12821.8. So even the lowest area option for present80_encryptBlock_hls is over the target. This suggests that the target cannot be met, and the best we can do is get as close as possible.\n\nBut how? The only way to reduce the area further is to select lower-area options for the child functions, but they already have the lowest area options. Unless there\'s a mistake in the data.\n\nWait, looking at generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s options: all have area around 2216 except option 4 (2241.9). So selecting option 0-3 for generateRoundKeys80_hls gives lower area. Similarly, addRoundKey_hls\'s options 2 and 3 have area 126.1, which is lower than other options. pLayer_hls\'s options 2 and 3 have area 719.4, which is lower than other options. copyKey and copyBlock already have their lowest area options selected.\n\nSo the total area of present80_encryptBlock_hls would be its own area plus the areas of its children. Wait, no. The present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area already includes the areas of generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc. Because when you synthesize a function, it includes the child functions. Therefore, the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls is the sum of its own logic plus the areas of all the child functions it calls. But according to the data, present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area is around 12.8k to 13.1k. If we can reduce the areas of the child functions, that would reduce the parent\'s area.\n\nBut the child functions\' lowest area options are already selected. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s lowest area is 2216.0 (option 0-3), addRoundKey_hls\'s lowest is 126.1 (options 2,3), pLayer_hls\'s lowest is 719.4 (options 2,3), copyKey_hls\'s lowest is 529.7 (options 1,3), copyBlock_hls\'s lowest is 427.6 (options 2,4). \n\nAssuming that present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area is the sum of its own logic plus the areas of generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc., then:\n\npresent80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area = its own area + generateRoundKeys80\'s area + addRoundKey\'s area + pLayer\'s area + ... \n\nBut according to the data, present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area is around 12.8k, which is much larger than the sum of the child areas. For example, generateRoundKeys80 (2216) + addRoundKey (126) + pLayer (719) + copyKey (529) + copyBlock (427) = 2216 + 126 + 719 + 529 + 427 = 4017. So the present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s own logic must be around 12.8k - 4k = 8.8k. This suggests that the majority of the area is in the present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s own implementation, not the children. Therefore, to reduce the total area, we need to focus on present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s options.\n\nThe present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s option 4 has the highest area (13187.5) but lowest latency (1978). The other options have lower area (12799.3 to 12821.8) but higher latency (2226). The target area is 10500, which is much lower than even the lowest present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area. This suggests that the target is impossible to meet, and the best we can do is get as close as possible. Therefore, the closest area would be the lowest present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area, which is 12799.3 (option 2 or 3). But that\'s still over 12k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the target area is a typo and should be higher, like 15000. But given the problem statement, we have to proceed with 10500.\n\nGiven this, perhaps the best approach is to select the lowest area options for all functions, even if it means higher latency, to get as close as possible to 10500. But the lowest area options for the child functions are already selected, and the present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s lowest area is 12799.3. So that\'s still over. Therefore, the problem might require accepting that the target cannot be met and finding the configuration with the lowest latency that has the closest area to 10500, even if it\'s over.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there\'s a misunderstanding in how the total area is calculated. If the total area is the sum of all functions\' areas (including multiple instances), but that\'s not how HLS works. Each function is synthesized once, and its area is counted once, regardless of how many times it\'s called. So the total area is the sum of the areas of all functions in the call graph, but considering that parent functions include their children. This is not the case, as parent functions\' areas include the children. Therefore, the total area is the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) plus any functions not included in it, like main. But main\'s area isn\'t given, so it\'s likely negligible.\n\nGiven all this, the initial step should be to synthesize the configuration with the lowest latency options for all functions to get a baseline. Then, if the area is too high, try to find a configuration that trades off some latency for lower area.\n\nBut since the user hasn\'t provided synthesis results yet, the first step is to choose a configuration to synthesize. Given that, the first request should be to synthesize a configuration with the lowest latency options for all functions to see the actual area and latency.\n\nThe configuration would be:\n\n- copyKey_hls option 1 (area 529.7, latency 1)\n- copyBlock_hls option 2 (area 427.6, latency 1)\n- generateRoundKeys80_hls option 0 (area 2216.0, latency 882)\n- addRoundKey_hls option 2 (area 126.1, latency 0)\n- pLayer_hls option 2 (area 719.4, latency 15)\n- present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 (area 13187.5, latency 1978)\n\nBut wait, present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s option 4 has the lowest latency. However, the child functions\' options are selected to minimize their latency, which might contribute to the parent\'s latency. But according to the problem statement, the parent\'s latency is already determined by its own options, which include the best child options. So selecting the best child options is already part of the parent\'s options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parent\'s latency is the sum of the child latencies plus its own. For example, present80_encryptBlock\'s latency includes generateRoundKeys80\'s latency (882) + addRoundKey\'s latency (0) + pLayer\'s latency (15) + etc. But according to the data, present80_encryptBlock\'s latency is 1978, which is much higher than the sum of the children\'s latencies. So the majority of the latency is in the parent\'s own processing.\n\nGiven this, the first step is to synthesize the configuration with the lowest latency options for all functions. Therefore, the first request should be:\n\nsynthesis: copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 4\n\nThis selects the lowest latency options for each function. After synthesizing, we can see the total area and latency. If the area is too high, we can then look for ways to reduce it by selecting higher-latency but lower-area options for some functions.\n\nHowever, the user\'s options for present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s option 4 has area 13187.5, which is the highest. So selecting this option would give the highest area but lowest latency. To get closer to the target area of 10500, we might need to choose a lower-area option for present80_encryptBlock_hls, even if it increases latency. For example, present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 has area 12799.3, which is lower than option 4\'s 13187.5. So perhaps selecting option 2 for present80_encryptBlock_hls and the best options for the children would give a lower area but higher latency.\n\nBut without knowing the actual synthesis results, it\'s hard to proceed. Therefore, the first step is to synthesize a baseline configuration to get actual numbers.\n</think>\n\nsynthesis: copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 4', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=6861657424617761000)], created=1741050622, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7729, prompt_tokens=1583, total_tokens=9312), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91ad8134fa9f5e7c', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, let\'s see. The user\'s goal is to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 10500. The last synthesis attempt resulted in a total area of 13187.5, which is way over the target. The latency was 1978. So, I need to find a configuration that reduces the area significantly without increasing latency too much.\n\nFirst, let\'s look at the functions involved. The main function is present80_encryptBlock_hls, which calls generateRoundKeys80, addRoundKey, pLayer, etc. The generateRoundKeys80 itself calls copyKey and copyBlock multiple times. \n\nIn the last configuration, present80_encryptBlock_hls was set to option 4, which has the lowest latency (1978) but a high area (13187.5). The other functions like copyKey_hls 1 and copyBlock_hls 2 were chosen for lower latency. But maybe some of these can be adjusted to reduce area.\n\nLooking at the options for present80_encryptBlock_hls, option 4 has the lowest latency but highest area. The other options (0-3) have higher latency (2226) but slightly lower area (around 12821). Maybe switching back to one of those could save area, but that would increase latency, which isn\'t ideal. However, the area is still over the target. So perhaps other functions need adjustment.\n\ngenerateRoundKeys80_hls was set to option 0 with area 2216. All options for this function have similar area except option 4 (2241.9). Maybe using a different option here won\'t help much. But since generateRoundKeys80 is called by present80_encryptBlock, maybe optimizing its child functions (copyKey and copyBlock) can help.\n\ncopyKey_hls was set to option 1 (area 529.7, latency 1). The other options for copyKey have higher area (1527.9) but much higher latency (19). Since option 1 is already the lowest area and latency, probably best to keep it.\n\ncopyBlock_hls was set to option 2 (area 427.6, latency 1). The other options have higher area (1175.3) and latency (15). So keeping option 2 here is good for area and latency.\n\naddRoundKey_hls was option 2 (area 126.1, latency 0). That\'s the best for both area and latency, so no change needed there.\n\npLayer_hls was option 2 (area 719.4, latency 15). The other options have higher area and latency. For example, option 0 has area 1007.7 and latency 150. So option 2 is optimal here.\n\nSo the main contributors to the high area are present80_encryptBlock_hls and generateRoundKeys80_hls. Since generateRoundKeys80\'s options are all around 2216, maybe there\'s no way to reduce that. But present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s option 4 is 13187.5 area. The other options are around 12821, which is still over the target. Hmm.\n\nWait, the target area is 10500, but the current total is 13187.5. That\'s a big gap. Maybe the sum of individual areas isn\'t additive because some functions are inlined or shared. But according to the problem statement, the area values reported for each function include their child functions. So the total area is just the area of the top function, present80_encryptBlock_hls, which in this case is 13187.5. So the user\'s target is to get this top function\'s area close to 10500. \n\nBut the options for present80_encryptBlock_hls are all around 12k-13k. The lowest area option is 12799.3 (options 2 and 3), which is still way above 10500. So maybe the target is impossible with the given options. But perhaps the user expects a combination where the sum of all individual function areas is close to 10500. Wait, no, the problem statement says that the area of a function includes its child functions. So the total area is just the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls), which in the last synthesis was 13187.5. The target is 10500, so we need to reduce that by about 2687.5.\n\nLooking at the options for present80_encryptBlock_hls, the lowest area is 12799.3 (options 2 and 3), which is still 2299.3 over the target. That\'s not enough. So maybe the only way is to choose a different option for present80_encryptBlock_hls that has a lower area but higher latency. Wait, option 4 for present80_encryptBlock_hls has higher area (13187.5) but lower latency. The other options have lower area but higher latency. For example, option 0 has area 12821.8 and latency 2226. So switching to option 0 would reduce area by about 365.7 but increase latency by 248. That\'s a trade-off, but the area is still way over target.\n\nThis suggests that the given options might not allow reaching the target area. But perhaps the user wants to get as close as possible. Alternatively, maybe the child functions can be optimized further to reduce the top function\'s area.\n\nWait, the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls includes all its child functions. So if we can reduce the area of its child functions, that would help. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls has an area of 2216.0 in option 0. If there\'s a way to reduce that, but looking at its options, all are around 2216 except option 4 (2241.9). So no help there.\n\nThe other child functions are addRoundKey_hls (area 126.1 in option 2), pLayer_hls (719.4 in option 2), copyKey_hls (529.7 in option 1), copyBlock_hls (427.6 in option 2). These are already the lowest area options. So perhaps there\'s no way to reduce the area further, meaning the target is unachievable. But the user might want the closest possible configuration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Perhaps the area values are additive. For example, the total area is the sum of all individual function areas. But according to the problem statement, when a function is synthesized, its area includes the child functions. So the top function\'s area is the total area. Therefore, the only way to reduce the total area is to choose a different option for present80_encryptBlock_hls that has a lower area, even if it increases latency.\n\nBut the options for present80_encryptBlock_hls are:\n\n- Option 0: 12821.8 area, 2226 latency\n\n- Option 4: 13187.5 area, 1978 latency\n\nSo option 0 has lower area but higher latency. If we choose option 0, the area is 12821.8, which is still over the target. But maybe combining this with other changes in child functions? Wait, but the child functions\' options are already at their minimal areas. So perhaps the only way is to accept that the target can\'t be met and find the configuration with the lowest latency that has the closest area to 10500, even if it\'s still over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some functions can be traded off. For example, using a higher latency but lower area option in some functions to reduce the total area. But looking at the options, most functions are already at their minimal area when optimized for latency. For example, copyKey_hls option 1 is the lowest area. Similarly for copyBlock_hls option 2. addRoundKey_hls option 2 is the lowest area. pLayer_hls option 2 is the lowest area. generateRoundKeys80_hls options are all similar except option 4, which is slightly higher. So there\'s not much room to reduce area further.\n\nWait, maybe the present80_encryptBlock_hls has an option with lower area. Let me check again:\n\nOptions for present80_encryptBlock_hls:\n\n0: 12821.8\n\n1: 12821.8\n\n2: 12799.3\n\n3: 12799.3\n\n4: 13187.5\n\nSo options 2 and 3 have the lowest area (12799.3). If we switch to option 2, the area would be 12799.3, which is still 2299.3 over the target. But maybe that\'s the closest possible. However, the latency would be 2226, which is higher than the previous 1978. So the user has to trade-off between latency and area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the target, but assuming the target is fixed, the agent needs to find the best possible configuration.\n\nAnother approach: use the Python script with OR-Tools to model this as an optimization problem. The variables are the options for each function, and the objective is to minimize latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 10500. But since the area is determined by the top function\'s option, which includes all child functions, the total area is the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s selected option. Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting the option for present80_encryptBlock_hls and its child functions\' options such that the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls is as close as possible to 10500, with minimal latency.\n\nBut the options for present80_encryptBlock_hls have fixed area and latency values. So the only variable is which option to choose for present80_encryptBlock_hls, and the options for its child functions are determined by the parent\'s synthesis. Wait, no. The problem statement says that when a function is synthesized, the child functions are included. So the options for child functions affect the parent\'s area and latency. Therefore, the total area and latency depend on the combination of options selected for all functions.\n\nBut in the previous synthesis, the user selected options for copyKey, copyBlock, etc., and the top function\'s area and latency were reported. So the total area is the sum of all individual function areas, but considering that each function\'s area includes its children. Wait, no. If a function\'s synthesis includes its children, then the area reported for the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) already includes all the child functions. Therefore, the total area is just the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s selected option. But the options for present80_encryptBlock_hls have fixed area values, which suggests that the area is determined by the option chosen for the top function, regardless of the child function options. But that doesn\'t make sense because the child functions\' options would affect the parent\'s area.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when a function is synthesized, it uses the best (lowest latency) options for its child functions. Therefore, the area reported for a function includes the child functions\' areas based on their best latency options. But when we select a specific option for a child function, that might change the parent\'s area and latency.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n"The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function."\n\nAh, so when a function is synthesized, it uses the best (lowest latency) options for its child functions. So the area and latency reported for a parent function\'s option are based on using the best child options. But when we explicitly select a different option for a child function, that overrides the default (best latency) choice, which can affect the parent\'s area and latency.\n\nTherefore, the total area and latency depend on the combination of options selected for all functions. For example, if we choose a child function\'s option with higher latency but lower area, that could reduce the parent\'s area but increase its latency.\n\nSo the problem is to select options for all functions (including child functions) such that the total area (sum of all selected function areas?) is close to 10500, and latency is minimized. But how is the total area calculated? If each function\'s area includes its children, then selecting a child\'s option would affect the parent\'s area. But this might lead to double-counting. Alternatively, the total area is the sum of the areas of all functions, but considering that when a parent function includes a child, the child\'s area is part of the parent\'s. This is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the total area is the area of the top function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) when synthesized with the selected options for all functions. Because when you synthesize the top function, it includes all child functions, so their options affect the top function\'s area.\n\nIn the previous synthesis, the user selected specific options for copyKey, copyBlock, etc., and the top function\'s area was 13187.5. So the total area is determined by the options selected for all functions in the hierarchy.\n\nTherefore, to model this correctly, we need to consider that each function\'s option contributes to the total area and latency, but the parent functions\' areas depend on the child functions\' options. However, this could be complex. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each function\'s area is independent of its children when a specific option is selected. For example, if you select option 1 for copyKey_hls, its area is 529.7, regardless of where it\'s used. Then, the total area would be the sum of all selected functions\' areas. But this might not be accurate because when a function is inlined into a parent, the area could be optimized.\n\nBut given the problem statement\'s ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the total area is the sum of the areas of all selected function options. For example, if we select copyKey_hls option 1 (529.7), copyBlock_hls option 2 (427.6), generateRoundKeys80_hls option 0 (2216.0), addRoundKey_hls option 2 (126.1), pLayer_hls option 2 (719.4), and present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 (13187.5), the total area would be 529.7 + 427.6 + 2216.0 + 126.1 + 719.4 + 13187.5 = let\'s calculate that:\n\n529.7 + 427.6 = 957.3\n\n957.3 + 2216.0 = 3173.3\n\n3173.3 + 126.1 = 3299.4\n\n3299.4 + 719.4 = 4018.8\n\n4018.8 + 13187.5 = 17206.3\n\nBut the synthesis report says the total area was 13187.5, which matches the present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4\'s area. This suggests that the area of the top function includes all child functions\' areas. Therefore, the total area is just the area of the top function\'s option, which already accounts for the child functions\' options selected. \n\nBut this contradicts the earlier statement that selecting different child options affects the parent\'s outcome. So perhaps when you select a specific option for a child function, the parent\'s area and latency are recalculated based on that child\'s option. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls is synthesized with copyKey_hls option 1, then generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area and latency would be different than if it used copyKey_hls option 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the reported values for each function\'s options are synthesized with the best child options (for latency). So when we select a child\'s option explicitly, it may change the parent\'s area and latency from their reported values.\n\nThis complicates things because the area and latency of a parent function depend on the child options selected. Therefore, the initial data provided (the options for each function) are based on using the best child options, but when we choose different child options, the parent\'s characteristics change.\n\nIn this case, the agent needs to explore different combinations of function options, considering that changing a child\'s option affects the parents\' area and latency. However, without knowing how exactly each combination affects the metrics, it\'s challenging. The only way is to synthesize different configurations and observe the results.\n\nGiven that, the previous synthesis attempt resulted in a total area of 13187.5 and latency 1978. To get closer to 10500, we need to find configurations with lower area. Let\'s consider other combinations.\n\nFor example, if we choose present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 (area 12799.3, latency 2226), that\'s lower area than option 4 but higher latency. But still over the target.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using different options for generateRoundKeys80_hls. For example, option 4 has area 2241.9, which is slightly higher than option 0\'s 2216.0. But that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using higher latency options for some child functions to reduce their area, thereby reducing the parent\'s area. For example, if we use copyKey_hls option 0 (area 1527.9, latency 19), which has higher area but higher latency. Wait, no, that would increase the area, which is worse. So that\'s not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe some functions have options with lower area but higher latency. For example, addRoundKey_hls option 2 has area 126.1 and latency 0, which is the best. Other options have higher area. So no help there.\n\npLayer_hls option 2 is the best for area and latency. So no changes there.\n\ngenerateRoundKeys80_hls options all have similar area except option 4. So no help.\n\ncopyBlock_hls option 2 is the best for area and latency.\n\nSo the main lever is the present80_encryptBlock_hls option. The lowest area option is 12799.3 (options 2 and 3), which is still way over 10500. Therefore, it\'s impossible to reach the target area with the given options. The closest possible is 12799.3, which is 2299.3 over. But the user might want the configuration with the lowest latency among those closest to the target area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a combination where the sum of individual function areas is closer to 10500. For example, if we consider that the top function\'s area is the sum of its own logic plus the areas of its children. But without explicit data on how each option affects the parent\'s area, it\'s hard to model.\n\nAlternatively, the agent should try different combinations and see. For example, trying present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 (area 12799.3) with other child functions at their minimal area options. But that\'s still over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the target area is a sum of all individual function areas, not the top function\'s area. For example, if the user wants the sum of all functions\' areas (copyKey, copyBlock, etc.) to be close to 10500. In that case, we need to sum the areas of all selected options.\n\nIn the previous synthesis, the selected options were:\n\ncopyKey_hls 1: 529.7\n\ncopyBlock_hls 2: 427.6\n\ngenerateRoundKeys80_hls 0: 2216.0\n\naddRoundKey_hls 2: 126.1\n\npLayer_hls 2: 719.4\n\npresent80_encryptBlock_hls 4: 13187.5\n\nSumming these: 529.7 + 427.6 = 957.3; +2216=3173.3; +126.1=3299.4; +719.4=4018.8; +13187.5=17206.3. That\'s way over 10500. But the synthesis report says the total area was 13187.5, which matches the present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4\'s area. So the total area is just the top function\'s area, which includes all children. Therefore, the target is to have the top function\'s area close to 10500.\n\nGiven that, and the available options for present80_encryptBlock_hls, the closest is 12799.3 (options 2 and 3), which is 2299.3 over. The next is 12821.8 (options 0 and 1), then 13187.5 (option 4). So the closest is 12799.3. Therefore, the best configuration would be present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 or 3, with the child functions set to their minimal area options to minimize latency.\n\nBut in the previous synthesis, the user selected present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4, which has higher area but lower latency. To get closer to the target area, we need to choose present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 or 3, even though it increases latency.\n\nSo the next step could be to synthesize present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 with the child functions at their minimal area options. Let\'s see:\n\nsynthesis: copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 2\n\nThis would use present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2, which has area 12799.3 and latency 2226. The child functions are set to their lowest area options. This might reduce the total area from 13187.5 to 12799.3, which is closer to 10500, but still over. The latency increases from 1978 to 2226.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a better combination. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls can be set to a different option that reduces area, but its options are all around 2216. So no help.\n\nAnother approach: use the Python script with OR-Tools to model this as an optimization problem. The variables are the options for each function, and the objective is to minimize latency while keeping the area as close as possible to 10500. However, without knowing how the area and latency of the top function depend on the child options, it\'s challenging. But perhaps the area of the top function is the sum of the areas of all selected function options. If that\'s the case, then the total area is the sum of all individual function areas, and the latency is the sum of all individual function latencies (but considering the call graph and how often each function is called).\n\nWait, the call graph shows that generateRoundKeys80 is called once by present80_encryptBlock, which is called once by main. generateRoundKeys80 calls copyKey and copyBlock multiple times. So the total latency would be the sum of the latencies of all functions in the call path, multiplied by the number of times they\'re called.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the latency reported for a function is when synthesized in isolation with the best child options. So when we select different child options, the parent\'s latency changes. This makes it complex to model without knowing the exact dependencies.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to try different configurations and see their area and latency. The previous attempt was option 4 for present80_encryptBlock_hls, resulting in area 13187.5 and latency 1978. Trying option 2 for present80_encryptBlock_hls might give area 12799.3 and latency 2226. If that\'s the case, the area is closer to 10500 (though still far), but latency is higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a configuration where some child functions use higher latency but lower area options, thereby reducing the total area. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls uses a different option that has lower area but higher latency, but according to the options, all generateRoundKeys80_hls options have the same area except option 4, which is higher. So no help.\n\nAnother idea: the function pLayer_hls has option 2 with area 719.4 and latency 15. Are there other options with lower area? Looking back, option 2 is the lowest. So no.\n\nSimilarly for addRoundKey_hls, option 2 is the best.\n\nSo the only variable is the present80_encryptBlock_hls option. Therefore, the agent should try synthesizing the top function with different options to see which gets closest to the target area.\n\nThe next step would be to synthesize present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 or 3 to check their area and latency. For example:\n\nsynthesis: copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 2\n\nThis would test if the area is indeed 12799.3 and latency 2226. If that\'s the case, it\'s closer to the target but still over. Then, the agent might need to accept that the target can\'t be met and choose the configuration with the lowest latency that has the closest area, which would be the previous one (option 4) with area 13187.5 and latency 1978.\n\nAlternatively, the agent could try using a different option for generateRoundKeys80_hls, but since all options have similar area, it\'s unlikely to help.\n\nAnother possibility is that the child functions\' options affect the top function\'s area. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls uses a different option, maybe the top function\'s area decreases. But according to the data, generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s options have area 2216.0 except option 4 (2241.9). So using option 4 would increase the area, which is worse.\n\nIn conclusion, the agent should try synthesizing present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 to see if the area decreases to 12799.3, then decide if that\'s the closest possible. If that\'s still too high, the next step might be to run a Python script using OR-Tools to find the optimal combination, but given the limited options, it might not yield a better result.\n</think>\n\nsynthesis: copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 2', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=18057667785305346000)], created=1741050740, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5734, prompt_tokens=1800, total_tokens=7534), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91ad8370c8cb440b', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, let\'s see. The user is trying to optimize a C application using HLS. The goal is to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 10500. The current configuration after two syntheses has an area of 13187.5 and 12799.3, both above the target. The latest latency is 2226, which is higher than the previous 1978. Hmm, maybe the present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 was better for latency but increased area.\n\nWait, the target area is 10500, so both results are over. Need to find a way to reduce area. Let\'s look at the functions. The main contributors are generateRoundKeys80_hls and present80_encryptBlock_hls. For generateRoundKeys80_hls, all options have area around 2216-2241.9. Maybe there\'s no way to reduce that. But copyKey_hls and copyBlock_hls have lower area options. The current config uses copyKey_hls 1 (area 529.7) and copyBlock_hls 2 (427.6). Those are already the lowest area options for those functions. \n\nAddRoundKey_hls is using option 2 (area 126.1), which is the lowest. pLayer_hls is using option 2 (719.4), which is the third option. Wait, pLayer_hls options: option 2 is 719.4, but option 3 is the same. Option 4 is 867.7. Maybe there\'s a lower area option. Wait, looking back: pLayer_hls options are:\n\n0: 1007.7\n1: 902.8\n2: 719.4\n3: 719.4\n4: 867.7\n\nSo options 2 and 3 have the same area. Maybe switching to option 3 doesn\'t change anything. So pLayer_hls is already at the lowest possible area for that function.\n\nThe present80_encryptBlock_hls has options with areas ranging from 12799.3 to 13187.5. The lowest area is 12799.3 (option 2 and 3), but their latency is 2226. The option 4 has lower latency (1978) but higher area (13187.5). So the user tried option 4 first, then option 2. \n\nThe total area is still way above 10500. Maybe the child functions are contributing to the area. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls calls copyKey and copyBlock multiple times. If those are already at minimal area, maybe the parent functions can\'t be reduced further. \n\nWait, the generateRoundKeys80_hls has area 2216.0 for options 0-3 and 2241.9 for option 4. So using option 0-3 gives lower area. But the user is already using option 0 for generateRoundKeys80_hls, which is the lowest area. \n\nSo the main issue is that the present80_encryptBlock_hls itself has a high area. Maybe there\'s a way to choose a different option for it that has lower area but higher latency. But the user wants to minimize latency. This is a trade-off. \n\nAlternatively, maybe some functions can be optimized further. Let\'s check if all child functions are at their minimal area. copyKey_hls is at option 1 (529.7), which is the lowest. copyBlock_hls is at option 2 (427.6), also the lowest. addRoundKey_hls is at option 2 (126.1), the lowest. pLayer_hls is at 719.4, which is the lowest. generateRoundKeys80_hls is at 2216.0. So all child functions are at their minimal area options. \n\nThe present80_encryptBlock_hls\'s area is 12799.3 in the latest synthesis. That\'s the main contributor. But the target is 10500. There\'s a big gap here. Maybe the user needs to explore if there\'s a way to reduce the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls. Looking at its options, the lowest area is 12799.3 (options 2 and 3), which is still way above 10500. So even the lowest option is over the target. \n\nThis suggests that the target area might not be achievable with the current function options. But the user wants to get as close as possible. The current configuration is at 12799.3, which is 2299.3 over the target. Maybe there\'s a way to reduce the area by selecting different options for the parent function, even if it increases latency. But the primary goal is to minimize latency while keeping area close to 10500. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the configuration. Let me check the functions again. The present80_encryptBlock_hls options: option 4 has area 13187.5 and latency 1978, while options 0-3 have higher latency (2226) but lower area (12821.8, 12821.8, 12799.3, 12799.3). Wait, the latest synthesis used present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2, which has area 12799.3. That\'s the lowest area for that function. \n\nSo the total area is 12799.3, but the target is 10500. The difference is 2299.3. That\'s a significant gap. Maybe the user needs to consider that the target is too low, but the problem states to keep as close as possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps some functions can be optimized by selecting higher latency options with lower area. Wait, but for the child functions, the lowest area options are already selected. For example, copyKey_hls option 1 has the lowest area. So there\'s no way to reduce their area further. \n\nIn this case, the minimal possible area is around 12799.3, which is higher than the target. Therefore, the best possible is to minimize latency while keeping area as low as possible. The present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 has higher area but lower latency. The user tried that first, got area 13187.5 and latency 1978. Then tried option 2, got area 12799.3 and latency 2226. \n\nSo the trade-off is between 1978 latency with higher area (13187.5) vs 2226 latency with lower area (12799.3). Since the target area is 10500, neither is close. But the user needs to find the best balance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a different combination of options for the child functions that can reduce the area further. Wait, but the child functions are already at their minimal area options. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls is using option 0 (area 2216.0), which is the lowest. So no improvement there. \n\nPerhaps the user should try to use the present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 (latency 1978, area 13187.5) and see if other functions can be adjusted to lower the area. But all child functions are already at minimal area. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can try different options for generateRoundKeys80_hls. For example, option 4 has area 2241.9, which is slightly higher than 2216.0, but maybe if combined with other options, the total area could be lower. But that seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can run a Python script using OR-Tools to model this as an optimization problem. The variables are the options for each function, with their area and latency. The objective is to minimize latency, subject to the total area as close as possible to 10500. \n\nBut given that the minimal area possible is around 12799.3, which is higher than 10500, the constraint would be infeasible. So the script would find the configuration with the minimal area, which is 12799.3, and then among those, the one with the lowest latency. \n\nAlternatively, the script could minimize the absolute difference between the total area and 10500, while minimizing latency. \n\nSo the user might need to run such a script to find the optimal combination. \n\nThe functions involved are copyKey_hls, copyBlock_hls, generateRoundKeys80_hls, addRoundKey_hls, pLayer_hls, and present80_encryptBlock_hls. Each has their own options with area and latency. \n\nThe total area is the sum of the areas of all functions, but wait, no. Wait, the area reported for each function includes the child functions. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls includes copyKey and copyBlock. So if we select options for copyKey and copyBlock, but generateRoundKeys80_hls is synthesized with those, the area of generateRoundKeys80_hls already includes the child functions. Therefore, the total area is just the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls, which includes all the child functions. \n\nWait, the problem statement says: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when a parent function is synthesized, it uses the best (probably minimal latency) options for the child functions. But when we select options for the child functions, that might override the default selection. \n\nWait, the user is supposed to select options for each function, including the child functions. The parent function\'s area and latency depend on the selected options of the child functions. So the total area is the sum of the areas of all selected function options. But that might not be correct, because when a parent function is synthesized, it includes the child functions. So the area of the parent function already includes the child functions\' areas. Therefore, the total area is just the area of the top-level function (present80_encryptBlock_hls), which includes all the child functions. \n\nBut the problem statement says: "the total area as close as possible to a target value". So the total area is the area of the top-level function, which includes all the child functions. Therefore, when selecting options for child functions, the parent function\'s area is affected. \n\nBut in the synthesis reports, the "Total Area Score" is the area of the top-level function. For example, in the first synthesis, the area was 13187.5 for present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4. In the second, 12799.3 for option 2. \n\nTherefore, the total area is determined by the options selected for all functions, but the top-level function\'s area includes all the child functions. So the user needs to select options for each function (including child functions) such that the top-level function\'s area is as close as possible to 10500, with minimal latency. \n\nBut how do the options of child functions affect the top-level function\'s area and latency? For example, if we choose a different option for copyKey_hls, which is a child of generateRoundKeys80_hls, which is a child of present80_encryptBlock_hls, then the area of generateRoundKeys80_hls would change, which in turn affects the area of present80_encryptBlock_hls. \n\nBut the problem states that the values reported for a function (like generateRoundKeys80_hls) are obtained by synthesizing it in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. So when we select an option for generateRoundKeys80_hls, it\'s using the best (minimal latency) options for its child functions (copyKey, copyBlock), regardless of the options we choose for those child functions. Wait, no. The user is supposed to select options for each function, including the child functions. So the parent function\'s synthesis would use the selected options of the child functions, not the best possible. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The problem statement says: "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when a function is synthesized in isolation, it uses the best (minimal latency) options for its child functions. But when the user selects specific options for the child functions, that overrides the default selection. \n\nTherefore, the total area and latency of the top-level function depend on the selected options for all functions in the hierarchy. \n\nSo to model this, each function\'s area and latency when a certain option is selected must include the effects of the selected options of its child functions. \n\nBut given the data provided, the area and latency for each function\'s option already include the child functions\' best options. For example, generateRoundKeys80_hls option 0 has area 2216.0, which includes the best (minimal latency) options for copyKey and copyBlock. But if the user selects a different option for copyKey, that would change the area and latency of generateRoundKeys80_hls. \n\nThis complicates the model because the area and latency of a parent function depend on the options selected for its children. Therefore, the total area is not simply the sum of all selected function options, but the area of the top-level function, which is affected by the options of all its descendants. \n\nGiven this, the user needs to find a combination of options for all functions such that the top-level function\'s area is as close as possible to 10500, with minimal latency. \n\nThis is a complex dependency. To model this, perhaps the user should run a script that considers the dependencies and calculates the total area and latency based on the selected options. \n\nBut given the information provided, the user has tried two configurations:\n\n1. copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 4. Result: area 13187.5, latency 1978.\n\n2. Same except present80_encryptBlock_hls 2. Result: area 12799.3, latency 2226.\n\nBoth are over the target area. The user needs to explore other combinations. \n\nPerhaps trying to use lower area options for generateRoundKeys80_hls. But all its options have similar area. Or maybe using a different option for pLayer_hls. For example, pLayer_hls option 2 and 3 have the same area and latency. Maybe option 3 is the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can try different options for addRoundKey_hls. The current selection is option 2 (area 126.1, latency 0). Are there other options with lower area? No, option 2 and 3 are the same. \n\nAnother approach: the target area is 10500, but the minimal achievable is around 12799.3. The difference is 2299.3. The user needs to get as close as possible. So the current closest is 12799.3. But maybe there\'s a configuration with even lower area. \n\nLooking at present80_encryptBlock_hls options, the lowest area is 12799.3 (options 2 and 3). So that\'s the minimal possible. Therefore, the user should select the configuration with present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 or 3, and the child functions at their minimal area options. \n\nBut in the second synthesis, the user selected present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2, which resulted in area 12799.3 and latency 2226. That\'s the closest to the target area. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a different combination where the top-level function\'s area is lower. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls uses a different option that has lower area. But all its options are around 2216.0 except option 4 (2241.9). So using option 0-3 for generateRoundKeys80_hls is better. \n\nAnother thought: perhaps the user can try different options for pLayer_hls. For example, option 4 has area 867.7, which is higher than option 2\'s 719.4. So using option 2 or 3 is better for area. \n\nSo the current configuration is already using the minimal area options for all child functions. Therefore, the minimal possible area is 12799.3. \n\nGiven that, the user should accept that the target area is not achievable and select the configuration with the lowest latency among those closest to the target area. \n\nBetween the two syntheses, the first has latency 1978 (area 13187.5) and the second 2226 (area 12799.3). The second is closer to the target area (10500) by 2299.3 vs 2687.5. Wait, 12799.3 - 10500 = 2299.3, and 13187.5 - 10500 = 2687.5. So the second configuration is closer in area. However, the latency is higher. \n\nThe user\'s goal is to minimize latency while keeping area as close as possible to 10500. So between the two, the second configuration is better in area but worse in latency. \n\nBut perhaps there\'s another configuration that balances area and latency better. For example, using present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 (latency 1978, area 13187.5) but adjusting other functions to lower the area. But all child functions are already at minimal area. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using a different option for generateRoundKeys80_hls. For example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls has an option with lower area, but the options are all similar. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can try to use a different option for present80_encryptBlock_hls that has a lower area. But options 2 and 3 are the lowest. \n\nIn this case, the user might need to accept that the closest area is 12799.3 and choose the configuration with the lowest latency possible under that area. But in the second synthesis, the latency is 2226. Is there a way to get lower latency with the same area? \n\nLooking at present80_encryptBlock_hls options, options 0-3 have latency 2226, and option 4 has 1978. But option 4 has higher area. So if the user wants to minimize latency, they might prefer option 4 even though the area is higher. But the goal is to get as close as possible to the target area. \n\nThis is a trade-off. The user needs to decide whether to prioritize area proximity or lower latency. \n\nAlternatively, the user can run a Python script using OR-Tools to model this as a multi-objective optimization problem, minimizing both the area difference and the latency. \n\nThe script would need to consider all possible combinations of function options, calculate the total area and latency, and find the configuration that minimizes latency while keeping the area as close as possible to 10500. \n\nGiven the dependencies, the total area is the area of the top-level function (present80_encryptBlock_hls), which depends on the selected options of all its child functions. \n\nBut how to model this? Each function\'s option has its own area and latency, but the parent\'s area includes the child\'s area. Wait, no. The area of the parent function when synthesized includes the child functions\' areas based on their selected options. \n\nFor example, if generateRoundKeys80_hls is synthesized with copyKey_hls option 1 and copyBlock_hls option 2, then the area of generateRoundKeys80_hls would be its own area plus the areas of copyKey and copyBlock. But according to the problem statement, the area reported for generateRoundKeys80_hls already includes the child functions\' areas when synthesized in isolation. \n\nThis is confusing. The problem statement says: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when generateRoundKeys80_hls is synthesized, it uses the best (minimal latency) options for copyKey and copyBlock, regardless of the user\'s selection. But the user can override the options for copyKey and copyBlock, which would affect the area and latency of generateRoundKeys80_hls. \n\nThis suggests that the area and latency values provided for each function\'s option are based on the best possible child function options (for latency), not the user-selected ones. Therefore, if the user selects a different option for a child function, the parent function\'s area and latency would change, but the provided data doesn\'t account for that. \n\nThis makes the problem more complex because the user\'s selection of child function options affects the parent\'s metrics, but the provided data for the parent\'s options is based on the best child options. \n\nIn this case, the user might need to assume that the area and latency of each function\'s option are fixed, regardless of the child function options selected. But that\'s not accurate. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be simplified by considering that the user\'s selection of child function options directly affects the parent\'s metrics. For example, if the user selects copyKey_hls option 1, then whenever copyKey is called by generateRoundKeys80_hls, it uses that option, affecting generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area and latency. \n\nBut the data provided for generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s options doesn\'t reflect this. The data shows generateRoundKeys80_hls\'s area as 2216.0 regardless of the copyKey and copyBlock options. This suggests that the data provided for each function\'s options already includes the child functions\' best options. \n\nTherefore, the user cannot further optimize by selecting different child function options, as the parent function\'s options already account for the best child options. \n\nThis would mean that the total area is simply the area of the top-level function (present80_encryptBlock_hls) based on its selected option, and the child functions\' options are irrelevant because the parent\'s options already include the best child options. \n\nBut this contradicts the initial problem statement where the user is supposed to select options for each function, including child functions. \n\nThis is a critical point. If the parent function\'s options already include the best child options, then the user only needs to select the option for the top-level function. But the problem allows selecting options for all functions, implying that the child function options affect the parent\'s metrics. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the user should run a Python script to model the dependencies and find the optimal combination. \n\nThe script would need to:\n\n1. For each function, have its options with area and latency.\n2. Model the call graph dependencies.\n3. Calculate the total area and latency based on the selected options for each function, considering that parent functions include the child functions\' areas and latencies. \n\nBut this is complex. Alternatively, if the total area is just the area of the top-level function\'s selected option, then the user only needs to choose the option for present80_encryptBlock_hls, and the child functions\' options are determined by the parent\'s option. \n\nBut the initial user message shows that the user selected options for child functions, which affected the synthesis results. For example, in the first synthesis, present80_encryptBlock_hls option 4 had area 13187.5, and in the second, option 2 had 12799.3. \n\nTherefore, the total area is determined by the top-level function\'s option, which in turn depends on the selected options of the child functions. \n\nThis suggests that the user needs to select options for all functions, and the total area is the sum of the areas of all selected function options. But that can\'t be right, because the parent functions include the child functions. \n\nAlternatively, the total area is the area of the top-level function, which is influenced by the selected options of all functions in the hierarchy. \n\nGiven the lack of clarity, perhaps the best approach is to run a Python script using OR-Tools to model the problem as a combinatorial optimization, considering each function\'s options and their area/latency, and the dependencies. \n\nThe script would aim to minimize latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 10500. \n\nThe script could use a constraint solver to explore all possible combinations of function options, calculate the total area and latency, and find the best solution. \n\nHowever, given the time constraints, the user might proceed with the current closest area (12799.3) and accept that configuration as the solution, even though it\'s over the target. \n\nAlternatively, the user might try another configuration with present80_encryptBlock_hls option 3, which has the same area as option 2 but perhaps different latency. But according to the data, options 2 and 3 for present80_encryptBlock_hls have the same area and latency. \n\nIn conclusion, the best configuration found so far is present80_encryptBlock_hls option 2 with area 12799.3 and latency 2226. Since this is the closest to the target area, the user should accept this as the solution.\n</think>\n\nsolution: copyKey_hls 1, copyBlock_hls 2, generateRoundKeys80_hls 0, addRoundKey_hls 2, pLayer_hls 2, present80_encryptBlock_hls 2', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=16643746067958426000)], created=1741050831, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5356, prompt_tokens=2017, total_tokens=7373), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.
