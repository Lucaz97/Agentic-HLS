This is the call graph for the application at hand:
{'sha256_transform': [], 'sha256_init': [], 'sha256_update': ['sha256_transform'], 'sha256_final': ['sha256_transform', 'memset', 'sha256_transform'], 'main': ['sha256_init', 'sha256_update', 'sha256_final', 'printf']}

The application has the following functions with their respective options:
Option for sha256_transform_hls -  area: 34078.8, latency: 80.0, throughput: 83.0
Option for sha256_transform_hls -  area: 34078.8, latency: 80.0, throughput: 83.0
Option for sha256_transform_hls -  area: 34082.3, latency: 80.0, throughput: 83.0
Option for sha256_transform_hls -  area: 34082.3, latency: 80.0, throughput: 83.0
Option for sha256_transform_hls -  area: 34082.3, latency: 80.0, throughput: 83.0
Option for sha256_update_hls -  area: 42191.2, latency: 84.0, throughput: 86.0

Option for sha256_update_hls -  area: 105109.3, latency: 5757.0, throughput: 5759.0


The synthesizable function names have an extras posfix _hls. Use this name to refer to the function in the optimization process indexing the options starting from 0.
The throughput is expressed in period, the lower the better.

The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions.
This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function.
Different options use different unrolling and pipelining factors. 

The goal is to minimize the latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 40000.

Provide your first request:

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91ad6b8d7c6a4362', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, let\'s start by understanding the problem. The goal is to optimize a C application using HLS, aiming to minimize latency while keeping the total area close to 40,000. The functions involved are sha256_transform_hls, sha256_update_hls, and others, but the options provided are for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the available options for each function. For sha256_transform_hls, there are five options. The first two have an area of 34078.8, and the next three are 34082.3. All have the same latency and throughput. Since the area differences are minimal, maybe choosing the first option (index 0) would be a good start to keep area low.\n\nFor sha256_update_hls, there are five options. The first, third, and fourth options have lower areas (around 42k, 41k, and 105k). Wait, the second option has a much higher area (156k) and higher latency. The fifth option (index 4) has a very high latency (5757) but area around 105k. The first option (index 0) has area 42191.2 and latency 84. That\'s a bit over the target area of 40k, but maybe combining with the transform\'s lower area could help.\n\nWait, the total area would be the sum of the areas of the selected functions. Let\'s see: if we pick sha256_transform_hls option 0 (34078.8) and sha256_update_hls option 0 (42191.2), the total area is 34078.8 + 42191.2 = 76270. That\'s way over 40k. Hmm, that\'s a problem. Wait, maybe I\'m misunderstanding. Are the areas for each function additive when they are used together? Because the parent functions include the child functions. For example, sha256_update calls sha256_transform. So if both are synthesized, maybe the area of sha256_update includes the area of sha256_transform? Or do we have to sum them?\n\nThe problem statement says: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function."\n\nSo when a parent function (like sha256_update_hls) is synthesized, it includes the child functions (like sha256_transform_hls). Therefore, the area reported for sha256_update_hls already includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Similarly, if we select options for both, but maybe the parent\'s area includes the child\'s. Wait, but the options for sha256_transform_hls are separate. So perhaps when you select an option for sha256_transform_hls, it affects the parent functions that call it. But the area of the parent function (e.g., sha256_update_hls) is reported when synthesized with the best child options. So maybe the area of the parent function already includes the child\'s area based on the selected option. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of all the top-level functions synthesized. But in this case, the main function calls sha256_init, sha256_update, sha256_final, etc. But the options are only for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. So perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of the functions that are synthesized with HLS, considering their options. But I\'m a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the user says: "The synthesizable function names have an extra suffix _hls. Use this name to refer to the function in the optimization process indexing the options starting from 0." So the functions with _hls are the ones being synthesized. The call graph shows that sha256_update calls sha256_transform. So if both are synthesized, then the area of sha256_update_hls would include the area of sha256_transform_hls, but only if the parent is synthesized with the child. But according to the problem statement, when a function is synthesized in isolation, it includes the child functions. So if we select an option for sha256_update_hls, its area already includes the sha256_transform_hls\'s area. But if we also select an option for sha256_transform_hls, does that override the one used in the parent? Or are the options for child functions determined by their own selections?\n\nThis is a bit unclear. The problem statement says: "Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function." So if we choose an option for sha256_transform_hls, then when the parent function (like sha256_update_hls) is synthesized, it uses that selected option for the child. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of all the synthesized functions (each with their own options). But wait, if a parent function includes a child function, then the area of the parent would already include the child\'s area. But if the child is also synthesized separately, that might lead to duplication. Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is that each function\'s area is considered once, and when a parent function includes a child, the child\'s area is part of the parent\'s. But if the child is also synthesized as a separate top-level function, then the total area would be the sum of the parent and child. But in this case, the call graph shows that sha256_update calls sha256_transform, and sha256_final also calls sha256_transform. So if sha256_transform is synthesized, then when sha256_update and sha256_final are synthesized, they would use the synthesized version of sha256_transform. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of all the synthesized functions. But in the options provided, the functions with options are sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. So perhaps the user is to select options for these two functions, and the total area is the sum of their selected options\' areas. But that might not account for the hierarchy. Alternatively, maybe the area of sha256_update_hls includes the area of sha256_transform_hls, so if both are selected, the total area would be the sum of sha256_update_hls\'s area (which includes sha256_transform_hls\'s area) plus any other synthesized functions. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of all the functions that are synthesized with HLS. For example, if we synthesize sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls, then the total area is the sum of their individual areas. But if sha256_update_hls includes sha256_transform_hls in its implementation, then this would double-count the area. So that can\'t be right. Therefore, the correct approach is that when a parent function is synthesized, it includes the child functions, so the area of the parent already includes the child\'s area. Therefore, if we synthesize sha256_update_hls, which includes sha256_transform_hls, then the area of sha256_update_hls is the total area for both. But if we also synthesize sha256_transform_hls separately, that would add its area again. But that\'s not efficient. Therefore, perhaps the user should only synthesize the top-level functions (like sha256_update_hls and sha256_final_hls, etc.), and their areas include the children. But in the given options, only sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls have options. So maybe the user needs to select options for these two, and the total area is the sum of their areas, considering that sha256_update_hls includes sha256_transform_hls. Wait, but that would mean that if we select both, the area is the sum, which would be incorrect because sha256_update_hls already includes sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is that if a function is synthesized (i.e., has an option selected), then its area is added to the total, and any child functions that are also synthesized would have their areas added as well. But this could lead to duplication. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to select options for each function that is called, and the total area is the sum of all selected functions\' areas. But in that case, if a parent function includes a child, the child\'s area is already part of the parent\'s, leading to overcounting. This is a critical point for the optimization.\n\nThe problem statement says: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when a function is synthesized in isolation, it includes the child functions. Therefore, the area reported for sha256_update_hls includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, if we select an option for sha256_update_hls, its area already includes the sha256_transform_hls\'s area. But if we also select an option for sha256_transform_hls, that would mean that the transform is synthesized separately, leading to duplication. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to only select options for the top-level functions (like sha256_update_hls, sha256_final_hls, etc.), and their areas include the children. But in the given options, only sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls have options. So maybe the user needs to select options for these two, but the area of sha256_update_hls includes the transform\'s area. Therefore, the total area would be the sum of the areas of all selected functions. But if sha256_update_hls is selected, and it includes sha256_transform_hls, then selecting both would sum their areas, leading to overcounting. Therefore, perhaps the user should only select options for the top-level functions, and the child functions are automatically included. But in this case, the options are given for both sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. So maybe the user has to choose whether to synthesize the transform as a separate function or let it be included in the update function. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each function\'s area is standalone, and when a parent function calls a child, the parent\'s area does not include the child\'s. Therefore, the total area is the sum of all functions\' areas that are synthesized. But this would mean that if sha256_update_hls calls sha256_transform_hls, both need to be synthesized, and their areas are summed. But in that case, the area of sha256_update_hls would not include the transform\'s area, which contradicts the problem statement. The problem statement says that when a function is synthesized in isolation, it includes the child functions. So the area reported for sha256_update_hls includes the transform\'s area. Therefore, if we select sha256_update_hls, we don\'t need to select sha256_transform_hls separately, because it\'s already included. But the options provided include both functions, which is confusing.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial assumption that each function\'s area is standalone, and the total area is the sum of the selected functions\' areas. However, given the problem statement, it\'s more likely that the area of a parent function includes the child functions. Therefore, if we select sha256_update_hls, its area already includes the transform\'s area, so we don\'t need to add the transform\'s area again. But the options for sha256_transform_hls are provided, which suggests that it can be synthesized separately. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is supposed to select options for each function that is called, and the total area is the sum of all selected functions\' areas. For example, if sha256_update_hls is called by main, and it calls sha256_transform_hls, then both need to be synthesized, and their areas are summed. But according to the problem statement, when a function is synthesized in isolation, it includes the child functions. So if we synthesize sha256_update_hls, its area includes the transform\'s area, so we don\'t need to synthesize the transform separately. But the options for the transform are given, which suggests that it can be optimized independently. This is a bit of a puzzle.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial options and see. Let\'s look at the options again.\n\nFor sha256_transform_hls, all options have similar areas (around 34k) and the same latency. So choosing any of them won\'t affect latency but might slightly affect area. The first two options (indices 0 and 1) have area 34078.8, the next three (indices 2,3,4) have 34082.3. So to minimize area, pick index 0 or 1.\n\nFor sha256_update_hls, the options vary more. The first option (index 0) has area 42191.2 and latency 84. The second (index 1) has area 156k and latency 433. The third (index 2) same as 0. Fourth (index3) area 41743.1, same latency. Fifth (index4) area 105k, latency 5757.\n\nThe goal is to minimize latency while keeping area close to 40k. The target area is 40k. So for sha256_update_hls, the options with lower area are indices 0,2,3. Their areas are around 42k, 42k, 41.7k. The fourth option (index3) has the lowest area (41743.1) and latency 84. So if we select that, the area is 41.7k. But the target is 40k. So maybe combining with the transform\'s area. Wait, but if the update\'s area includes the transform\'s area, then the total area would be 41.7k (update) + 34k (transform) = 75.7k, which is way over. But that can\'t be right. Alternatively, if the update\'s area already includes the transform\'s area, then the total area would be 41.7k, which is over 40k but closer. But the target is 40k. So perhaps we need to find a combination where the total area is as close as possible to 40k.\n\nWait, but the problem says "keeping the total area as close as possible to a target value". So the total area is the sum of the areas of all the synthesized functions. But if the update\'s area includes the transform\'s area, then selecting both would sum their areas, leading to overcounting. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to only select the parent functions (like update) and not the child (transform), because the parent\'s area includes the child\'s. But the options provided include both functions, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each function\'s area is standalone, and the total area is the sum of all selected functions. For example, if we select sha256_transform_hls (34k) and sha256_update_hls (41.7k), the total is 75.7k. But that\'s way over 40k. So that\'s not acceptable. Therefore, perhaps the only way to get close to 40k is to select only the update function with the lowest area. But the update\'s lowest area is 41.7k (index3), which is over 40k. Alternatively, maybe the transform function\'s area is 34k, and if we can find a way to have only that function synthesized, but the main function calls update, which calls transform. So if we synthesize transform, but not update, then the update would be implemented in software, which might not be efficient. But the problem states that the application is accelerated using HLS, so likely the critical functions are synthesized.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let\'s try to proceed with the initial step. The user needs to select options for the functions with _hls suffix. The options are for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. The goal is to minimize latency while keeping total area close to 40k.\n\nAssuming that the total area is the sum of the areas of the selected functions. For example, if we select sha256_transform_hls option 0 (34k) and sha256_update_hls option3 (41.7k), total area is 34k +41.7k=75.7k. That\'s way over. But the target is 40k. So this approach won\'t work. Therefore, perhaps the area of the parent function includes the child\'s area. So if we select sha256_update_hls option3 (41.7k), which includes the transform\'s area (34k), then the total area is 41.7k. That\'s still over 40k, but closer. Alternatively, maybe the area of the update function is standalone, and the transform\'s area is added if it\'s synthesized. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is supposed to select options for each function that is called, and the total area is the sum of their areas. But given that the target is 40k, and the transform\'s area is 34k, the remaining 6k would have to come from other functions. But the update\'s options are all over 40k. So this seems impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nFor sha256_update_hls, option3 has area 41743.1. That\'s 41.7k. If that\'s the area of the update function including the transform, then the total area would be 41.7k. That\'s over the target of 40k by 1.7k. Alternatively, if the update\'s area is standalone and the transform\'s area is added, then 41.7k +34k=75.7k. But that\'s way over.\n\nThis suggests that the only way to get close to 40k is to select the update function with the lowest possible area, which is option3 (41.7k), and not select the transform function. But if the update function includes the transform\'s area, then the total area is 41.7k, which is over. Alternatively, if the update\'s area is standalone, and the transform is not synthesized, then the area would be 41.7k, but the transform would be implemented in software, which might not be desired.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the target area is 40k, and the user needs to find a combination that gets as close as possible. The closest would be sha256_update_hls option3 (41.7k), which is 1.7k over. Alternatively, maybe there\'s a way to combine options for both functions to get closer. For example, if we select sha256_transform_hls option0 (34k) and sha256_update_hls option3 (41.7k), but if the update\'s area includes the transform\'s, then the total would be 41.7k. If not, it\'s 75.7k. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best first step is to synthesize a configuration to see what the actual area and latency are. For example, select sha256_transform_hls option0 and sha256_update_hls option3. Then see the reported total area and latency. If the area is 34k +41.7k=75.7k, that\'s way over. But if the area is just 41.7k (assuming update includes transform), then that\'s closer. But without knowing, it\'s hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should start by inspecting the options to understand their areas and latencies better. For example, inspect the options for both functions to see if there\'s a combination that can get closer to the target area.\n\nBut the user can only choose one action per step. The first step could be to inspect the options for both functions. For example:\n\ninspect: sha256_transform_hls 0, sha256_update_hls 3\n\nBut the inspect command would return the details of those options. However, the user already provided the options\' details. The options for sha256_transform_hls are all similar in area and latency. The sha256_update_hls options have varying areas and latencies.\n\nAlternatively, the user could run a Python script using OR-Tools to model this as an optimization problem. The variables are the options selected for each function, and the objective is to minimize latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 40k.\n\nThe problem can be modeled as follows:\n\nVariables:\n- transform_option (0-4)\n- update_option (0-4)\n\nConstraints:\n- The total area (sum of the areas of the selected options) should be as close as possible to 40k.\n\nObjective:\n- Minimize the sum of the latencies of the selected options.\n\nBut wait, the latency of the application is determined by the critical path, which might be the sum of the latencies of the functions called in sequence. However, the problem states that the goal is to minimize the latency, which is the total latency of the application. But the provided latencies for each function are their individual latencies when synthesized in isolation. So the total latency would be the sum of the latencies of all the functions called. But the call graph shows that main calls sha256_init, sha256_update, sha256_final, etc. But the options are only for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. So perhaps the total latency is the sum of the latencies of the synthesized functions. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the latency of the application is dominated by the functions that are synthesized. For example, if sha256_update_hls is synthesized with a certain latency, and it\'s called multiple times, the total latency would be the number of calls multiplied by its latency. But without knowing the number of calls, it\'s hard to model. The problem statement might assume that the total latency is the sum of the latencies of the synthesized functions, considering their call hierarchy.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to run a Python script using OR-Tools to find the combination of options that minimizes latency while keeping the total area as close as possible to 40k.\n\nThe script would need to:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible combinations of options for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls.\n2. For each combination, calculate the total area (sum of their areas) and total latency (sum of their latencies).\n3. Find the combination with the minimum latency where the area is closest to 40k.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the goal is to minimize latency while keeping the area as close as possible to 40k. So the primary objective is to minimize latency, and the secondary objective is to minimize the difference from the target area.\n\nThe script can model this as a multi-objective optimization problem. However, OR-Tools can handle this by minimizing a weighted sum of latency and area difference. Alternatively, find the combination with the smallest latency where the area is within a certain threshold of 40k.\n\nBut given that the target is to keep the area as close as possible, perhaps the approach is to find the combination with the minimum latency, and among those, the one with the area closest to 40k.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as a constraint optimization problem where the area must be <= 40k + tolerance, and the goal is to minimize latency. But given that the options\' areas are all above 34k, and the update\'s options are around 42k, it\'s impossible to reach 40k. So perhaps the closest possible is to find the combination with the smallest area exceeding 40k and the lowest latency.\n\nAlternatively, the problem allows for the area to be as close as possible, even if it\'s over. So the best combination is the one with the lowest latency and the area closest to 40k.\n\nLet\'s proceed to write a Python script using OR-Tools to find this.\n\nThe script would:\n\n- Iterate over all possible combinations of options for the two functions.\n- For each combination, compute the total area and total latency.\n- Compute the absolute difference between the total area and 40k.\n- Find the combination with the smallest latency. If there are multiple with the same latency, choose the one with the smallest area difference.\n\nBut given that the functions\' latencies are additive, but the call graph may have multiple calls, but the problem statement doesn\'t provide the number of calls. So perhaps the total latency is the sum of the latencies of the functions selected. But the call graph shows that sha256_update calls sha256_transform, and sha256_final calls it twice. So if sha256_transform is synthesized, its latency would be added each time it\'s called. But the problem statement\'s data provides the latency of each function when synthesized in isolation, which includes the child functions. So perhaps the latency of sha256_update_hls includes the latency of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, the total latency would be the sum of the latencies of the top-level functions (like sha256_update_hls and sha256_final_hls), which already include the child latencies. But in the given options, only sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls have options. So perhaps the total latency is the sum of the latencies of the selected functions. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed under the assumption that the total latency is the sum of the latencies of the selected functions, and the total area is the sum of their areas. Then, find the combination that minimizes latency while keeping the area as close as possible to 40k.\n\nThe Python script would:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible combinations of options for the two functions.\n2. For each combination, calculate total_area = area_transform + area_update.\n3. Calculate the absolute difference from 40000: diff = abs(total_area - 40000).\n4. Among all combinations, find those with the minimum latency. If multiple, choose the one with the smallest diff.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nFor sha256_transform_hls, all options have latency 80. So the latency of the transform is fixed at 80. For sha256_update_hls, the latencies are 84, 433, 84, 84, 5757. So the minimum latency for update is 84. Therefore, the minimum total latency would be 80 + 84 = 164.\n\nNow, the area for transform options are around 34k, and for update, the options with latency 84 have areas around 42k, 42k, 41.7k. So the total area would be 34k + 42k = 76k, which is way over. But if the area of the update includes the transform\'s area, then the total area would be 42k, which is still over. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, if the update\'s area includes the transform\'s area, then selecting update option3 (area 41743.1) would give a total area of 41.7k, which is 1.7k over the target. That\'s the closest possible. The latency would be 84 (update) + 80 (transform?) or just 84 if the update\'s latency includes the transform\'s. But the problem statement says that the latency reported for a function includes the child functions. So the latency of sha256_update_hls (84) already includes the latency of sha256_transform_hls (80). Therefore, the total latency would be 84 (for update) plus any other functions. But the main function calls sha256_init, sha256_update, sha256_final, etc. But the options are only for update and transform. So perhaps the total latency is dominated by the update and final functions. But without their options, it\'s hard to say.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best first step is to run a Python script to find the optimal combination based on the given data, assuming that the total area is the sum of the selected functions\' areas and the total latency is the sum of their latencies.\n\nThe script would look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom ortools.sat.python import cp_model\n\n# Define the options for each function\ntransform_options = [\n    {\'area\': 34078.8, \'latency\': 80.0},\n    {\'area\': 34078.8, \'latency\': 80.0},\n    {\'area\': 34082.3, \'latency\': 80.0},\n    {\'area\': 34082.3, \'latency\': 80.0},\n    {\'area\': 34082.3, \'latency\': 80.0},\n]\n\nupdate_options = [\n    {\'area\': 42191.2, \'latency\': 84.0},\n    {\'area\': 156387.1, \'latency\': 433.0},\n    {\'area\': 42191.2, \'latency\': 84.0},\n    {\'area\': 41743.1, \'latency\': 84.0},\n    {\'area\': 105109.3, \'latency\': 5757.0},\n]\n\nmodel = cp_model.CpModel()\n\n# Variables: indices for transform and update options\nt = model.NewIntVar(0, 4, \'transform\')\nu = model.NewIntVar(0, 4, \'update\')\n\n# Area and latency variables\ntotal_area = model.NewIntVar(0, 500000, \'total_area\')\ntotal_latency = model.NewIntVar(0, 10000, \'total_latency\')\n\n# Calculate total_area and total_latency\nmodel.Add(total_area == (\n    model.NewIntVarFromDomain(cp_model.Domain.FromValues([int(opt[\'area\']) for opt in transform_options]), \'t_area\') +\n    model.NewIntVarFromDomain(cp_model.Domain.FromValues([int(opt[\'area\']) for opt in update_options]), \'u_area\')\n))\n\nmodel.Add(total_latency == (\n    model.NewIntVarFromDomain(cp_model.Domain.FromValues([int(opt[\'latency\']) for opt in transform_options]), \'t_latency\') +\n    model.NewIntVarFromDomain(cp_model.Domain.FromValues([int(opt[\'latency\']) for opt in update_options]), \'u_latency\')\n))\n\n# Objective: minimize a weighted sum of latency and area difference from 40000\ntarget_area = 40000\narea_diff = model.NewIntVar(0, 500000, \'area_diff\')\nmodel.AddAbsEquality(area_diff, total_area - target_area)\n\n# Minimize latency first, then area_diff\nmodel.Minimize(total_latency * 1000 + area_diff)\n\nsolver = cp_model.CpSolver()\nstatus = solver.Solve(model)\n\nif status == cp_model.OPTIMAL:\n    t_val = solver.Value(t)\n    u_val = solver.Value(u)\n    print(f"Optimal solution: transform option {t_val}, update option {u_val}")\n    print(f"Total area: {solver.Value(total_area)}, Total latency: {solver.Value(total_latency)}")\nelse:\n    print("No solution found.")\n```\n\nThis script models the problem with the objective to minimize latency first, then the area difference. However, OR-Tools might not handle the floating-point areas directly, so converting them to integers. Also, the model might need to use element constraints to link the selected options to their area and latency.\n\nBut this script has issues. For example, the variables t and u are indices, but the model needs to connect them to their respective area and latency values. The current code doesn\'t do that correctly. Instead, the correct approach is to use element constraints.\n\nHere\'s a corrected version:\n\n```python\nfrom ortools.sat.python import cp_model\n\ntransform_options = [\n    {\'area\': 34078.8, \'latency\': 80.0},\n    {\'area\': 34078.8, \'latency\': 80.0},\n    {\'area\': 34082.3, \'latency\': 80.0},\n    {\'area\': 34082.3, \'latency\': 80.0},\n    {\'area\': 34082.3, \'latency\': 80.0},\n]\n\nupdate_options = [\n    {\'area\': 42191.2, \'latency\': 84.0},\n    {\'area\': 156387.1, \'latency\': 433.0},\n    {\'area\': 42191.2, \'latency\': 84.0},\n    {\'area\': 41743.1, \'latency\': 84.0},\n    {\'area\': 105109.3, \'latency\': 5757.0},\n]\n\nmodel = cp_model.CpModel()\n\nt = model.NewIntVar(0, 4, \'transform\')\nu = model.NewIntVar(0, 4, \'update\')\n\n# Transform area and latency\nt_area = model.NewIntVar(0, 100000, \'t_area\')\nt_latency = model.NewIntVar(0, 1000, \'t_latency\')\nmodel.AddElement(t, [int(opt[\'area\']) for opt in transform_options], t_area)\nmodel.AddElement(t, [int(opt[\'latency\']) for opt in transform_options], t_latency)\n\n# Update area and latency\nu_area = model.NewIntVar(0, 500000, \'u_area\')\nu_latency = model.NewIntVar(0, 10000, \'u_latency\')\nmodel.AddElement(u, [int(opt[\'area\']) for opt in update_options], u_area)\nmodel.AddElement(u, [int(opt[\'latency\']) for opt in update_options], u_latency)\n\ntotal_area = model.NewIntVar(0, 600000, \'total_area\')\nmodel.Add(total_area == t_area + u_area)\n\ntotal_latency = model.NewIntVar(0, 20000, \'total_latency\')\nmodel.Add(total_latency == t_latency + u_latency)\n\ntarget_area = 40000\narea_diff = model.NewIntVar(0, 600000, \'area_diff\')\nmodel.AddAbsEquality(area_diff, total_area - target_area)\n\n# Minimize latency first, then area difference\nmodel.Minimize(total_latency * 1000 + area_diff)\n\nsolver = cp_model.CpSolver()\nstatus = solver.Solve(model)\n\nif status == cp_model.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f"Solution found:")\n    print(f"sha256_transform_hls option {solver.Value(t)}")\n    print(f"sha256_update_hls option {solver.Value(u)}")\n    print(f"Total area: {solver.Value(total_area)}, Total latency: {solver.Value(total_latency)}")\nelse:\n    print("No solution found.")\n```\n\nThis script uses element constraints to link the selected option indices to their area and latency values. The objective is to minimize a weighted sum where latency is prioritized (multiplied by 1000) plus the area difference. This way, the solver will first minimize latency, then the area difference.\n\nRunning this script would find the combination with the lowest possible latency (80 + 84 = 164) and the smallest area difference. The possible combinations for latency 164 are:\n\n- transform option 0-4 (all have area ~34k) and update options 0,2,3 (area ~42k, 42k, 41.7k).\n\nThe total area for these combinations would be:\n\n34k + 42k = 76k (diff 36k)\n34k + 41.7k = 75.7k (diff 35.7k)\n\nBut wait, the update\'s area is around 42k, and the transform\'s is 34k. So the total area is 76k, which is way over the target of 40k. This suggests that the initial assumption is incorrect, and the area of the update function includes the transform\'s area. Therefore, the total area would be just the update\'s area (e.g., 41.7k for option3), which is closer to 40k.\n\nIn that case, the script should consider only the update\'s area, assuming that it includes the transform\'s. But the problem statement says that the options for the transform are available, which complicates things.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to synthesize a configuration with sha256_update_hls option3 (area 41743.1, latency 84) and not select the transform, assuming that the update\'s area includes the transform\'s. Then the total area is 41.7k, latency 84. But according to the problem statement, the transform is a child of the update, so the update\'s area includes the transform\'s. Therefore, selecting only the update\'s option3 would give area 41.7k and latency 84. That\'s the closest to the target area. The latency is 84, which is the lowest possible for the update function.\n\nTherefore, the first step could be to synthesize this configuration: sha256_update_hls option3. But according to the problem\'s instructions, the user must select options for all synthesizable functions. The functions with options are sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. So perhaps both need to be selected. But if the update\'s area includes the transform\'s, then selecting both would sum their areas, leading to overcounting. But if the update\'s area already includes the transform\'s, then selecting the transform\'s option would have no effect. This is unclear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best first step is to run the Python script as written, which would output the optimal combination based on the current assumptions. If the script\'s output is to select transform option0 and update option3, with total area 34078.8 +41743.1 = 75821.9, which is 75k, way over the target. But this can\'t be right. Therefore, the initial assumption that the areas are summed is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach must be that the area of the parent function includes the child\'s area. Therefore, when selecting sha256_update_hls, its area includes the transform\'s. Therefore, the total area is just the area of the update function. In that case, the best option is to select sha256_update_hls option3 (area 41743.1) and not select the transform function. But the problem requires selecting options for all synthesizable functions. The available functions are sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. So perhaps the user must select an option for both, but the area of the update includes the transform\'s. Therefore, selecting both would sum their areas, leading to overcounting. But that\'s not possible. Therefore, the correct approach is to select only the update function\'s option, and the transform\'s option is not needed because it\'s included. But the problem states that the user must select options for the synthesizable functions, which include both. This is a contradiction.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the best first step is to synthesize the configuration with sha256_update_hls option3 and sha256_transform_hls option0, to see what the actual area and latency are. If the area is 34k +41.7k =75.7k, then it\'s over. If the area is just 41.7k, then that\'s better. But without synthesizing, we can\'t know.\n\nTherefore, the first action should be to synthesize a configuration to get actual data. For example:\n\nsynthesis: sha256_transform_hls 0, sha256_update_hls 3\n\nThis will provide the actual area and latency, which can then be used to adjust the approach.\n</think>\n\nsynthesis: sha256_transform_hls 0, sha256_update_hls 3', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=18245008880689132000)], created=1741049853, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=8391, prompt_tokens=929, total_tokens=9320), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.

LLM RAW RESPONSE:  ChatCompletion(id='91ad6f9cbbda577b', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, let\'s see. The user wants to optimize the HLS configuration to minimize latency while keeping the area close to 40,000. The last synthesis used sha256_transform_hls option 0 and sha256_update_hls option 3, resulting in a total area of 41,743.1, which is a bit over the target. The latency was 84.0.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available options again. For sha256_transform_hls, all options have similar areas around 34k, and latency 80. So changing that might not help much. The main focus is on sha256_update_hls. The options for sha256_update_hls are:\n\n0: area 42k, latency 84\n1: area 156k, latency 433 (too high area)\n2: same as 0\n3: area 41,743.1, latency 84 (this was tried)\n4: area 105k, latency 5757 (way too high latency)\n\nSo options 0,2,3 have similar latency but varying areas. The last synthesis used option 3, which has the lowest area among them (41,743.1). But the target is 40k. Maybe try to find a combination where the total area is closer. Since sha256_transform_hls is part of sha256_update_hls, maybe using a lower area option for sha256_transform could help. Wait, looking at the options for sha256_transform_hls:\n\nOptions 0 and 1 have area 34,078.8, options 2,3,4 have 34,082.3. So the first two options are slightly lower. If the user used option 0 for sha256_transform_hls, maybe switching to option 1 (same area) won\'t change anything. But maybe combining sha256_transform_hls option 0 with sha256_update_hls option 0 or 2 (which have higher area than 3). Wait, no: sha256_update_hls option 3 has a lower area (41,743.1) compared to option 0 (42,191.2). So the previous choice was better.\n\nWait, the total area reported was 41,743.1, which is the sum of sha256_transform and sha256_update? Or is that the area of sha256_update_hls alone? The problem statement says that when synthesizing a function, the child functions are included. So when synthesizing sha256_update_hls, it includes the sha256_transform_hls. So the area of sha256_update_hls option 3 is 41,743.1, which already includes the sha256_transform_hls\'s area. Wait, no. The user\'s initial data lists the options for each function. For example, sha256_update_hls options have their own area, which probably includes the child functions. So when you select an option for sha256_update_hls, its area is already considering the child functions (like sha256_transform_hls). But in the problem statement, it says "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So the area of sha256_update_hls option 3 (41,743.1) already includes the area of sha256_transform_hls with the best possible options for that child. Wait, no. Wait, the problem statement says: "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when synthesizing sha256_update_hls, the tool selects the best (probably lowest latency) options for its child functions (sha256_transform_hls). But in the user\'s initial options, sha256_transform_hls has multiple options, but all have the same latency (80) except maybe different areas. So when synthesizing sha256_update_hls, it would pick the sha256_transform_hls option that gives the best latency, which is all the same. So the area of sha256_update_hls includes the area of the best sha256_transform_hls option. But in the initial data, the options for sha256_update_hls have their own area values. So maybe each option for sha256_update_hls is synthesized with a specific option of sha256_transform_hls. Wait, the user\'s instruction says: "synthesize a new configuration to evaluate its latency throughput and area." So when the user selects a configuration, they specify the options for each function. For example, in the first synthesis, they chose sha256_transform_hls 0 and sha256_update_hls 3. That means that when synthesizing sha256_update_hls, it uses the specified option for sha256_transform_hls. Wait, no. The functions are synthesized in isolation, but when you select an option for a parent function, it uses the selected options for the child functions. Or maybe each function\'s options are independent. This is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem statement says: "The values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions. This means that the child functions are included in the function synthesis. Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function." So when you synthesize a parent function (like sha256_update_hls), it uses the best possible options for the child functions (sha256_transform_hls) to get the best latency. But when you select a specific option for the child function, that overrides the "best" selection. Wait, no. The user is supposed to select options for each function. For example, if you choose sha256_transform_hls option 0, then when synthesizing sha256_update_hls, it uses that option for the child function. So the parent function\'s area and latency depend on the options selected for the child functions. Therefore, the total area is the sum of the areas of all selected functions. But wait, the initial data lists the area for each function\'s option, which already includes the child functions. For example, sha256_update_hls\'s area includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. But that\'s not clear. Alternatively, each function\'s area is standalone, and when combined, the total area is the sum of all selected functions. But given that sha256_update calls sha256_transform, the area of sha256_update would include the area of sha256_transform. But according to the problem statement, when you synthesize a function, the child functions are included. So the area reported for sha256_update_hls includes the area of sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, the total area of the application would be the sum of the areas of all top-level functions (like main, sha256_init, etc.), but since main is not synthesized, perhaps the total area is the sum of the synthesized functions. But the user\'s target is 40k. The previous synthesis of sha256_update_hls option 3 gave a total area of 41,743.1, which is over the target. So the goal is to find a combination where the total area is as close as possible to 40k, but with minimal latency.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nsha256_transform_hls has options 0-4. Options 0 and 1 have area 34,078.8, others slightly higher. But all have the same latency. So changing the option for sha256_transform_hls might not affect latency but could affect area. However, if the parent function (sha256_update_hls) includes the child\'s area, then selecting a lower area option for sha256_transform_hls could reduce the total area of sha256_update_hls. Wait, but the area of sha256_update_hls\'s options are already fixed. For example, if sha256_update_hls option 3 has area 41,743.1, which includes the sha256_transform_hls\'s area. So if we choose a different sha256_transform_hls option, would that affect the area of sha256_update_hls? Or is the area of sha256_update_hls\'s options fixed, regardless of the child\'s options? This is a critical point. The problem statement says: "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when you look at the area of sha256_update_hls option 3, that area already includes the best (for latency) child function options. But when the user selects a specific option for the child function, that overrides the "best" selection. Therefore, the area of the parent function would change based on the selected child options. But in the initial data, the options for each function are pre-defined. So perhaps each function\'s options are independent, and the total area is the sum of all selected function options. For example, if you select sha256_transform_hls option 0 (area 34,078.8) and sha256_update_hls option 3 (area 41,743.1), the total area would be 34k + 41k = 75k. But that\'s way over the target. But the previous synthesis result showed a total area of 41,743.1, which suggests that the area of sha256_update_hls already includes the child functions. Therefore, the total area is just the sum of the areas of the top-level functions that are synthesized. But the application\'s main function calls sha256_init, sha256_update, sha256_final, which in turn call other functions. However, the synthesizable functions are those with _hls suffix. So sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls are the ones being synthesized. The other functions (sha256_init, sha256_final, main) are not synthesized, so their area is not considered. Therefore, the total area is the sum of the areas of the synthesized functions. But in the previous synthesis, only sha256_update_hls was synthesized, and its area is 41,743.1, which includes the sha256_transform_hls\'s area. Wait, but the user\'s initial data lists options for both sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. So perhaps each function\'s options are synthesized separately, and the total area is the sum of all synthesized functions. For example, if both sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls are synthesized, their areas are added. But in the previous synthesis, the user selected both functions\' options. However, the synthesis report shows a total area of 41,743.1, which is the area of sha256_update_hls option 3. This suggests that when synthesizing sha256_update_hls, it includes the area of sha256_transform_hls, so the total area is just the area of sha256_update_hls. Therefore, the options for sha256_transform_hls are part of the options for sha256_update_hls. But the initial data lists them as separate functions with their own options. This is confusing. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem statement says: "the values reported for a function are obtained synthesizing the function in isolation, selecting the best latency from the child functions." So when you synthesize a parent function, it includes the child functions, and the area reported for the parent includes the child\'s area. Therefore, the total area of the application would be the sum of the areas of the top-level functions that are synthesized. For example, if main is not synthesized, but sha256_update_hls is synthesized, and it includes sha256_transform_hls, then the total area is just the area of sha256_update_hls. But the user\'s initial data lists options for both sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. So perhaps each function\'s options are synthesized independently, and when a parent function is synthesized, it uses the selected option for the child function. Therefore, the total area is the sum of the areas of all synthesized functions. For example, if you select sha256_transform_hls option 0 (area 34k) and sha256_update_hls option 3 (area 41k), the total area would be 34k + 41k = 75k. But that\'s way over the target. However, the previous synthesis result showed a total area of 41,743.1, which matches the area of sha256_update_hls option 3. This suggests that when synthesizing sha256_update_hls, the tool automatically includes the necessary child functions, and their areas are part of the parent\'s area. Therefore, the total area is just the area of the top-level synthesized functions. So in this case, sha256_update_hls is the top-level function being synthesized, and its area includes the child sha256_transform_hls. Therefore, selecting different options for sha256_transform_hls would affect the area and latency of sha256_update_hls. But according to the initial data, the options for sha256_update_hls have fixed area and latency values, which suggests that those values already include the child functions\' best options. Therefore, the user\'s initial data for sha256_update_hls options already account for the child functions\' areas. So when you select an option for sha256_update_hls, its area is fixed as per the data, and you don\'t need to add the child\'s area. But this contradicts the problem statement\'s instruction that selecting different options for child functions affects the parent\'s outcome. Therefore, there\'s a misunderstanding here. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem statement says: "Selecting a different option will affect the final outcome of the parent function." So if you choose a different option for sha256_transform_hls, the parent function (sha256_update_hls) will have different area and latency. Therefore, the area and latency of sha256_update_hls depend on the option selected for sha256_transform_hls. But in the initial data, the options for sha256_update_hls have fixed area and latency values. This suggests that each option for sha256_update_hls is synthesized with a specific option of sha256_transform_hls. For example, sha256_update_hls option 3 might use sha256_transform_hls option 0, resulting in a certain area. But the user can override this by selecting a different option for sha256_transform_hls. However, the initial data doesn\'t specify which child options were used for each parent option. This is a problem. The user needs to know how the parent function\'s options relate to the child function\'s options. Without that information, it\'s impossible to accurately model the dependencies. Given this ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to assume that each parent function\'s option is synthesized with the best possible child function options (for latency), and when the user selects a specific child option, it overrides that. Therefore, the area of the parent function would change based on the selected child option. For example, if sha256_update_hls option 3 has an area of 41,743.1 when using the best child option (which might be sha256_transform_hls option 0), but if the user selects sha256_transform_hls option 1 (same area), the parent\'s area remains the same. However, if the user selects a different child option with a higher area, the parent\'s area would increase. But this is speculative. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the user should try different combinations of parent and child options to see how the total area and latency change. \n\nIn the previous synthesis, the user selected sha256_transform_hls 0 and sha256_update_hls 3, resulting in a total area of 41,743.1. The target is 40k. To reduce the area, they need to find a combination that brings the total closer. Let\'s look at the options again:\n\nsha256_transform_hls options 0 and 1 have area 34,078.8. Options 2-4 are slightly higher. But if the parent function\'s area includes the child\'s area, then using a lower area child might help. However, in the previous synthesis, the total area was 41,743.1, which is the area of sha256_update_hls option 3. If that includes the child\'s area, then perhaps the child\'s area is part of that 41k. So maybe the child\'s area is already accounted for in the parent\'s area. Therefore, changing the child\'s option might not affect the parent\'s area. But this contradicts the problem statement\'s note that selecting different child options affects the parent\'s outcome. \n\nAlternatively, the total area is the sum of all selected function options. For example, if you select sha256_transform_hls option 0 (34k) and sha256_update_hls option 3 (41k), the total area is 34k + 41k = 75k. But that\'s way over the target. However, the previous synthesis result showed a total area of 41k, which suggests that the parent\'s area includes the child\'s. Therefore, the total area is just the area of the top-level function (sha256_update_hls) which includes the child. So in that case, selecting different child options would change the parent\'s area. For example, if sha256_update_hls option 3 uses sha256_transform_hls option 0 (34k), then the total area is 41k. If we can find a sha256_transform_hls option with lower area, maybe the total area would decrease. But looking at the options, the lowest area for sha256_transform_hls is 34,078.8 (options 0 and 1). The next options are slightly higher. So perhaps there\'s no way to reduce the child\'s area further. Therefore, the parent\'s area can\'t be reduced below 41k. But the target is 40k. So maybe the user needs to try a different parent option with lower area. Looking at sha256_update_hls options:\n\nOption 0: area 42,191.2 (higher than 41k)\nOption 1: 156k (too high)\nOption 2: same as 0\nOption 3: 41,743.1 (the one tried)\nOption 4: 105k (too high)\n\nSo option 3 is the lowest area for sha256_update_hls. But it\'s still over 40k. The target is 40k, so perhaps the user needs to find a way to reduce the area further. Maybe combining different options for the child and parent. For example, if there\'s a sha256_transform_hls option with lower area, but the options provided don\'t have that. All sha256_transform_hls options are around 34k. So perhaps the total area can\'t be reduced further. In that case, the user might have to accept the closest possible area (41k) and focus on minimizing latency. But the latency for sha256_update_hls option 3 is 84, which is the lowest among the options except for option 4, which has a much higher latency. So the current configuration is already the best for latency. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a mistake in the initial data. For example, sha256_update_hls option 3 has area 41,743.1, which is the lowest. The target is 40k. The difference is about 1.7k. Maybe there\'s a way to adjust other functions. But the other functions (sha256_init, sha256_final, main) are not synthesized, so their area isn\'t considered. Therefore, the only way to reduce the area is to find a lower area option for sha256_update_hls. But according to the data, option 3 is the lowest. \n\nWait, looking back at the options for sha256_update_hls:\n\nOption 3: area 41,743.1\nOption 0: 42,191.2\nOption 2: same as 0\nOption 4: 105k\n\nSo option 3 is the best in terms of area. But it\'s still over 40k. Maybe the user needs to try other combinations. For example, using sha256_transform_hls option 0 and sha256_update_hls option 3 gives total area 41,743.1. If there\'s a way to reduce the area by 1.7k, but the options don\'t allow that. Therefore, the closest possible is 41k. The user might have to accept that and proceed. However, the problem statement says to keep the area as close as possible to 40k. So maybe the user should try other functions. Wait, the application has other functions like sha256_final, which calls sha256_transform and memset. But those functions (sha256_final) are not listed as having HLS options. Only sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls have options. Therefore, the only functions to optimize are those two. \n\nAnother angle: the problem statement says that the goal is to minimize latency while keeping the area as close as possible to 40k. The current configuration has latency 84 and area 41,743.1. Is there a configuration with lower latency but higher area? Looking at sha256_update_hls options:\n\nOption 4 has latency 5757, which is way higher. Option 1 has latency 433. So the best latency is 84 (options 0,2,3). So the current configuration is already the best for latency. Therefore, the optimal solution is to use sha256_transform_hls option 0 (or any, since they have same latency) and sha256_update_hls option 3, giving latency 84 and area 41,743.1. Since this is the closest to the target area, maybe this is the solution. But the user might want to check if there\'s a way to get a lower area. However, based on the given options, there\'s no lower area option for sha256_update_hls. \n\nAlternatively, maybe combining different options for sha256_transform_hls and sha256_update_hls. For example, if sha256_transform_hls option 0 has area 34k and sha256_update_hls option 3 has area 41k, but if the total area is the sum, that\'s 75k. But the previous synthesis result showed a total area of 41k, implying that the parent\'s area includes the child\'s. Therefore, the total area is just the parent\'s area. So the child\'s area is part of the parent\'s. Therefore, changing the child\'s option would affect the parent\'s area. But according to the initial data, the child\'s options have areas around 34k, but the parent\'s options have areas around 41k. If the parent\'s area includes the child\'s, then the child\'s area is part of the parent\'s. Therefore, if the user selects a different child option with lower area, the parent\'s area would decrease. But the child\'s options 0 and 1 have the same area. So selecting option 1 for the child wouldn\'t change anything. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the parent\'s area is fixed, and the child\'s area is separate. But that doesn\'t align with the previous synthesis result. This is confusing. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the current configuration as the best possible, given the options. Therefore, the solution would be sha256_transform_hls 0 and sha256_update_hls 3. But the user might want to confirm by trying other combinations. For example, what if we use sha256_update_hls option 0 and sha256_transform_hls option 0? The area would be 42,191.2, which is higher than the previous 41k. So worse. Alternatively, maybe using sha256_transform_hls option 2 (area 34,082.3) and sha256_update_hls option 3 (41,743.1). But that would increase the child\'s area slightly, possibly making the parent\'s area higher. But according to the initial data, the parent\'s area is fixed per option. So changing the child\'s option doesn\'t affect the parent\'s area. Therefore, the parent\'s area is fixed, and the child\'s area is part of it. Therefore, the user can\'t change the child\'s option to affect the parent\'s area. \n\nGiven all this, the best configuration is sha256_transform_hls 0 and sha256_update_hls 3, with area 41,743.1 and latency 84. Since this is the closest to the target area of 40k, and the lowest latency, this is the optimal solution. Therefore, the next step is to accept this as the solution.\n</think>\n\nsolution: sha256_transform_hls 0, sha256_update_hls 3', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[]), seed=43571040315097390)], created=1741050019, model='deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5155, prompt_tokens=1107, total_tokens=6262), prompt=[], warnings=[{'message': 'max_tokens exceed the model limit.
