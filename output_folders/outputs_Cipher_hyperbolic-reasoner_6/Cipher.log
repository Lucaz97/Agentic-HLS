Agent sequence:  ['synthesis: Cipher_hls 1', "python: '''", "python: '''", "python: '''", "python: '''", "python: '''", 'solution: Cipher_hls 3', 'synthesis: Cipher_hls 4', 'synthesis: Cipher_hls 1', 'synthesis: Cipher_hls 0', 'synthesis: Cipher_hls 2', 'synthesis: Cipher_hls 3', 'synthesis: Cipher_hls 4</think>', '\'". This seems like a syntax error in the Python script where there\'s an unexpected character. But the user\'s last attempt was a synthesis command: "synthesis: AddRoundKey_hls 0, SubBytes_hls 1, ShiftRows_hls 0, xtime 0, MixColumns_hls 0, Cipher_hls 4". The error mentions \'4', 'The latest error message is "too many values to unpack (expected 2)", which suggests that somewhere in the code, a function is expecting two values but receiving more. This could be due to incorrect formatting in the synthesis command, such as missing commas or extra spaces. The user\'s last synthesis command was "synthesis: AddRoundKey_hls 0, SubBytes_hls 1, ShiftRows_hls 0, xtime 0, MixColumns_hls 0, Cipher_hls 4", which seems correctly formatted. However, the error might be arising from how the backend processes this input, perhaps splitting on spaces incorrectly and getting more parts than expected.', 'synthesis: AddRoundKey_hls 0, SubBytes_hls 1, ShiftRows_hls 0, xtime 0, MixColumns_hls 0, Cipher_hls 4', 'solution: AddRoundKey_hls 0, SubBytes_hls 1, ShiftRows_hls 0, xtime 0, MixColumns_hls 0, Cipher_hls 4']
